    Process quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) outputs from Multiwfn.

    Args:
        molecule (Molecule): structure corresponding to this Multiwfn calculation
        file (PathLike): path to CPprop file containing QTAIM information
        bond_atom_criterion (Literal["qtaim", "distance"]): If "qtaim", the inherent bonding definition obtained from
            QTAIM/Multiwfn will be used to link bond CPs to atoms involved in those bonds; if "distance", a
            distance-based metric will be used instead, where the atoms closest to the bond CP will be assumed to be
            bonded.
        max_distance (float): Maximum distance (in Angstrom) that an atom critical point can be away from an atom
            center and be associated with that atom. Default is 0.5 Angstrom
        dist_threshold_bond (float): If the nearest atoms to a bond CP are further from the bond CP than this threshold
            (default 1.0 Angstrom), then a warning will be raised.
        dist_threshold_ring_cage (float): If the nearest bond CPs to a ring CP or the nearest ring CPs to a cage CP are
            further than this threshold (default 3.0 Angstrom), then a warning will be raised.
        distance_margin (float): Rings must be made up of at least three bonds, and cages must be made up of at least
            three rings. We therefore define rings by the three closest bond CPs and cages by the three closest ring
            CPs. We associate additional bond/ring CPs with ring/cage CPs if they are no further than the third-closest
            bond/ring CP, plus this margin. Default is 0.5 Angstrom
