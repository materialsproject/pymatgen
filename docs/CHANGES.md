## v2025.6.14

- Treat LATTICE_CONSTRAINTS as is for INCARs.
- PR #4425 `JDFTXOutfileSlice.trajectory` revision by @benrich37
    Major changes:
    - feature 1: `JDFTXOutfileSlice.trajectory` is now initialized with `frame_properties` set
    -- `JOutStructure.properties` filled with relevant data for `frame_properties`
    -- More properties added to `JOutStructure.site_properties`
    ## Todos
    - Remove class attributes in `JOutStructure` now redundant to data stored in `JOutStructure.properties` and `JOutStructure.site_properties`
- PR #4431 Single source of truth for POTCAR directory structure by @esoteric-ephemera
    Modifies the pymatgen CLI to use the same POTCAR library directory structure as in `pymatgen.io.vasp.inputs` to close #4430. Possibly breaking from the CLI side (the directory structure will change)
    Pinging @mkhorton since #4424 was probably motivated by similar concerns?
- PR #4433 Speed up symmetry functions with faster `is_periodic_image` algorithm by @kavanase
    I noticed that in some of our `doped` testing workflows, `SpacegroupAnalyzer.get_primitive_standard_structure()` is one of the main bottlenecks (as to be expected). One of the dominant cost factors here is the usage of `is_periodic_image`, which can be expensive for large structures due to many `np.allclose()` calls.
    This PR implements a small change to instead use an equivalent (but faster) pure Python loop, which also breaks early if the tolerance is exceeded.
    In my test case, this reduced the time spent on `is_periodic_image` (and thus `SpacegroupAnalyzer.get_primitive_standard_structure()`) from 35s to 10s.
- PR #4432 Fingerprint sources by @JaGeo
    Add correct papers to tanimoto fingerprints
- PR #4061 Fix branch directory check in `io.vasp.outputs.get_band_structure_from_vasp_multiple_branches` by @DanielYang59
    ### Summary
    - Fix branch directory check in `io.vasp.outputs.get_band_structure_from_vasp_multiple_branches`, to fix #4060
    - [ ] Improve unit test (waiting for data, I don't have experience with "VASP multi-branch bandstructure calculation")
- PR #4409 Packmol constraints by @davidwaroquiers
    Added possibility to set individual constraints in packmol.
    Added some sanity checks.
    Added unit tests.
- PR #4428 Fixes a bug in `NanoscaleStability.plot_one_stability_map` and `plot_all_stability_map`. by @kmu
    Major changes:
    - Replaced incorrect `ax.xlabel()` and `ax.ylabel()` calls with correct `ax.set_xlabel()` and `ax.set_ylabel()`.
    - Added `ax.legend()` to `plot_all_stability_map` so that labels passed via `ax.plot(..., label=...)` are displayed.
    - Added `test_plot()` to `test_surface_analysis.py`.
- PR #4424 Add additional name mappings for new LDA v64 potcars by @mkhorton
    As title.
- PR #4426 Fix uncertainty as int for `EnergyAdjustment` by @DanielYang59
    - Avoid `==` or `!=` for possible float comparison
    - Fix uncertainty as int for `EnergyAdjustment` cannot generate repr:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.entries.computed_entries import EnergyAdjustment
    print(EnergyAdjustment(10, uncertainty=0))
    ```
    Gives:
    ```
    Traceback (most recent call last):

- PR #4421 Cache `Lattice` property (`lengths/angles/volume`) for much faster `Structure.as_dict` by @DanielYang59
    ### Summary
    - `lengths/angles/volume` of `Lattice` would now be cached, related to #4385
    - `verbosity` in `as_dict` of `PeriodicSite/Lattice` now explicitly requires literal 0 or 1 to be consistent with docstring, instead of checking `if verbosity > 0` (currently in grace period, only warning issued) https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/34608d0b92166e5fc4a9dd52ed465ae7dccfa525/src/pymatgen/core/lattice.py#L904-L905
    ---
    ### Cache frequently used `Lattice` properties
    Currently `length/angles/volume` is not cached and is frequently used, for example accessing all lattice parameter related property would lead to `length/angles` being repeatedly calculated: https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/34608d0b92166e5fc4a9dd52ed465ae7dccfa525/src/pymatgen/core/lattice.py#L475-L524
    `structure.as_dict` now around 8x faster
    Before (1000 structure, each has 10-100 atoms):

    Also note `lattice` (the performance bottleneck) is not used in the dict for site: https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/34608d0b92166e5fc4a9dd52ed465ae7dccfa525/src/pymatgen/core/structure.py#L2856-L2857
    So we could modify `as_dict` to control whether lattice would be generated at all
    This could reduce the runtime slightly so I guess it's not worth the effort:

- PR #4391 Add custom as_dict/from_dict method for proper initialization of attributes of IcohpCollection by @naik-aakash
    Currently `IcohpCollection` instance is not serialized correctly, thus I added custom  from_dict  and as_dict methods here.

## v2025.5.28

- PR #4411 Add `orjson` as required dependency as default JSON handler when custom encoder/decoder is not needed by @DanielYang59
- PR #4417 adding radd dunder method to Volumetric data + test_outputs by @wladerer
- PR #4418 `JDFTXOutfileSlice` Durability Improvement by @benrich37
    Major changes:
    - feature 1: Improved durability of `JDFTXOutfileSlice._from_out_slice` method (less likely to error out on unexpected termination)
    -- So long as one step of electronic minimization has started on an out file slice, parsing shouldn't error out
    - fix 1: Allow partially dumped eigstats
    - fix 2: Added missing optical band gap dumped by eigstats
    - fix 3: Protect the final `JOutStructure` in initializing a `JOutStructures` with a try/except block
    - fix 4: Detect if positions were only partially dumped and revert to data from `init_structure` in `JOutStructure`
    - fix 5: Prevent partially dumped matrices from being used in initializing a `JOutStructure`
    ## Todos
    - feature 1: Ensure parse-ability as long as a `JDFTXOutfileSlice.infile` can be initialized
- PR #4419 Fix Molecule.get_boxed_structure when reorder=False by @gpetretto
- PR #4416 `JDFTXInfile` Comparison Methods by @benrich37
    Major changes:
    - feature 1: Convenience methods for comparing `JDFTXInfile` objects
    -- `JDFTXInfile.is_comparable_to`
    --- Returns True if at least one tag is found different
    --- Optional arguments `exclude_tags`, `exclude_tag_categories`, `ensure_include_tags` to ignore certain tags in the comparison
    ---- `exclude_tag_categories` defaults to `["export", "restart", "structure"]` as `"export"` and `"restart"` are very rarely pertinent  to comparability, `"structure"` as subtags of this category are generally the one thing being intentionally changed in comparisons (ie different local minima or a slab with/without an adsorbate)
    -- `JDFTXInfile.get_filtered_differing_tags`
    --- What is used in `JDFTXInfile.is_comparable_to` to get filtered differing tags between `JDFTXInfile` objects
    --- Convenient as a "verbose" alternative to `JDFTXInfile.is_comparable_to`
    -- `AbstractTag.is_equal_to` and `AbstractTag._is_equal_to`
    --- Used in tag comparison for finding differing tags
    --- `AbstractTag._is_equal_to` is an abstract method that must be implemented for each `AbstractTag` inheritor
    - feature 2: Default `JDFTXInfile` object `pymatgen.io.jdftx.inputs.ref_infile`
    -- Initialized from reading default JDFTx settings from `pymatgen.io.jdftx.jdftxinfile_default_inputs.default_inputs: dict`
    -- Used in `JDFTXInfile.get_differing_tags_from` for tags in `self` missing from `other` that are identical to the default setting
    - fix 1: Re-ordered contents of `JDFTXInfile` to follow the order: magic methods -> class methods / transformation methods -> validation methods -> properties -> private methods
    - fix 2: Checking for `'selective_dynamics'` in `site_properties` for a `Structure` passed in `JDFTXInfile.from_structure` (used if `selective_dynamics` argument left as `None`)
    ## Todos
    - feature 1: Add examples to documentation on how to properly use new comparison methods
    - feature 2: Improve the mapping of `TagContainer`s to their default values
    -- The current implementation of comparison for tags to default values only works if the tag as written exactly matches the full default value - at the very least the missing subtags of a partially filled `TagContainer` needs to be filled with the default values before comparing to the full default value
    -- Some subtags also change depending on the other subtags present for a particular tag (ie convergence threshold depending on algorithm specified for `'fluid-minimize'`, so an improved mapping for dynamic default values needs to be implemented
- PR #4413 `JDFTXOutputs.bandstructure: BandStructure` by @benrich37
    Major changes:
    - feature 1: Added 'kpts' storable variable to JDFTXOutputs
    -- Currently only able to obtain from the 'bandProjections' file
    - feature 2: Added `bandstructure` attribute to JDFTXOutputs
    -- Standard pymatgen `BandStrucure` object
    -- Request-able as a `store_var`, but functions slightly differently
    --- Ensures 'eigenvals' and 'kpts' are in `store_vars` and then is deleted
    -- Initialized if JDFTXOutputs has successfully stored at least 'kpts' and 'eigenvals'
    -- Fills `projections` field if also has stored 'bandProjections'
    - feature 3: Added `wk_list` to `JDFTXOutputs`
    -- List of weights for each k-point
    -- Currently doesn't have a use, but will be helpful for `ElecData` initializing in [`crawfish`](https://github.com/benrich37/crawfish)
    ## Todos
    - feature 1: Add reading 'kpts' from the standalone 'kPts' file dumped by JDFTx
    - feature 2: Outline how we might initialize `BandStructureSymmLine`(s) for calculations with explicitly defined 'kpoint' tags, as using 'kpoint's instead of `kpoint-folding` is most likely an indicator of a band-structure calculation
- PR #4415 speed-up Structure instantiation by @danielzuegner
    This PR speeds up the instantiation of `Structure` objects by preventing hash collisions in the `lru_cache` of `get_el_sp` and increasing its `maxsize`. The issue is that currently `Element` objects are hashed to the same value as the integer atomic numbers (e.g., `Element[H]` maps to the same hash as `int(1)`). This forces the `lru_hash` to perform an expensive `__eq__` comparison between the two, which reduces the performance of instantiating many `Structure` objects. Also here we increase the `maxsize` of `get_el_sp`'s `lru_cache` to 1024 for further performance improvements.
    This reduces time taken to instantiate 100,000 `Structure` objects from 31 seconds to 8.7s (avoid hash collisions) to 6.1s (also increase `maxsize` to 1024).
- PR #4410 JDFTx Inputs - boundary value checking by @benrich37
    Major changes:
    - feature 1: Revised boundary checking for input tags
    -- Added a `validate_value_bounds` method to `AbstractTag`, that by default always returns `True, ""`
    -- Added an alternate `AbstractNumericTag` that inherits `AbstractTag` to implement `validate_value_bounds` properly
    --- Changed boundary storing to the following fields
    ---- `ub` and `lb`
    ----- Can either be `None`, or some value to indicate an upper or lower bound
    ---- `ub_incl` and `lb_incl`
    ----- If True, applies `>=` instead of `>` in comparative checks on upper and lower bounds
    -- Switched inheritance of `FloatTag` and `IntTag` from `AbstractTag` to `AbstractNumericTag`
    -- Implemented `validate_value_bounds` for `TagContainer` to dispatch checking for contained subtags
    -- Added a method `validate_boundaries` to `JDFTXInfile` to run `validate_value_bounds` on all contained tags and values
    -- Added `validate_value_boundaries` argument for initialization methods of `JDFTXInfile`, which will run `validate_boundaries` after initializing `JDFTXInfile` but before returning when True
    --- Note that this is explicitly disabled when initializing a `JDFTXInfile` from the input summary in a `JDFTXOutfileSlice` - boundary values may exist internally in JDFTx for non-inclusive bounded tags as the default values, but cannot be passed in the input file. For this reason, errors on boundary checking must be an easily disabled feature for the construction and manipulation of a  `JDFTXInfile`, but out-of-bounds values must never be written when writing a file for passing to JDFTx.
    ## Todos
    - feature 1
    -- Implement some way boundary checking can run when adding tags to a pre-existing `JDFTXInfile` object
    --- boundary checking is currently only run when initializing from a pre-existing collection of input tags
    --- writing this into `JDFTXInfile.__setitem__` is too extreme as it would require adding an attribute to `JDFTXInfile` to allow disabling the check
    --- the better solution would be to implement a more obvious user-friendly method for reading in additional inputs so that the user doesn't need to learn how to properly write out the dictionary representation of complicated tag containers.
    -- Fill out reference tags for other unimplemented boundaries
- PR #4408 `to_jdftxinfile` method for JDFTXOutfile by @benrich37
    Major changes:
    - feature 1: Method `to_jdftxinfile` for JDFTXOutfile(Slice)
    -- Uses internal `JDFTXInfile` and `Structure` to create a new `JDFTXInfile` object that can be ran to restart a calculation
    - feature 2: Method `strip_structure_tags` for `JDFTXInfile`
    -- Strips all structural tags from a `JDFTXInfile` for creating equivalent `JDFTXInfile` objects with updated associated structures
    - fix 1: Changing 'nAlphaAdjustMax' shared tag from a `FloatTag` to an `IntTag`
    - fix 2: Adding an optional `minval` field for certain `FloatTag`s which prevent writing error-raising values
    -- Certain tag options in JDFTx can internally be the minimum value, but trying to pass the minimum value will raise an error
    ## Todos
    - feature 1: Testing for the `to_jdftxinfile`
    -- I know the function works from having used it, but I haven't written in an explicit test for it yet.
    - fix 2: Look through JDFTx source code and identify all the numeric tag value boundaries and add them to the FloatTag. This will likely require generalizing how boundaries are tested as a quick glance (see [here](https://github.com/shankar1729/jdftx/blob/master/jdftx/commands/fluid.cpp#L378)) shows there are tags that actually do use the `>=` operator
    - Unrelated: Reduce bloat in outputs module
    -- Remove references to deprecated fields
    -- Begin phasing out redundant fields
    --- i.e. `JDFTXOutfile.lattice` redundant to `JDFTXOutfile.structure.lattice.matrix`
    -- Generalize how optimization logs are stored in outputs module objects
    --- Fields like `grad_K` are part of a broad group of values that can be logged for an optimization step, and the fields present in each log varies a lot more than I previously thought when I initially wrote the JDFTx outputs module. Generalizing how these are stored into a dictionary of arbitrary keys should make the outputs module more robust, as well as helping reduce the bloat in the outputs module.
- PR #4407 JDFTXInfile addition (`__add__`) method tweak by @benrich37
    Changing addition method - now infiles with shared keys will either concatenate their inputs if the key is for a repeatable tag, or change to whatever value is in the second infile if it is not a repeatable tag. A bare minimum `if subval in params[key]` check is done to avoid adding duplicate values. This seems like something the `set` built-in could help with, but since the sub-values are dictionaries, using `set` is a little more difficult
    Major changes:
    - fix 1: Addition of two JDFTXInfiles (`jif1 = jif2 + jif3`) no longer requires each `jif2` and `jif3` to have a unique set of tags
    -- For a non-repeatable tag 'key', `jif1['key'] == jif3['key']`
    -- For a repeatable-tag 'key', `jif1['key'] = jif2['key'] + [val for val in jif3['key'] if not val in jif2['key']`
    -- implemented in `src/pymatgen/io/jdftx/inputs.py`
    -- tested in `tests/io/jdftx/test_jdftxinfile.py`
    --- error raising test for conflicting tag values removed
    ## Todos
    - fix 1: Add more robust checking for if two repeatable tag values represent the same information.
    -- This is likely fixed by implementing the pre-existing TODO - "Add default value filling like JDFTx does"
    - fix 2: Incorporate something to collapse repeated dump tags of the same frequency into a single value.
    -- The 'dump' tag currently can get bloated very quickly, as the newly implemented change for concatenating two repeatable tags will not detect that something like `{"End": {"State": True}}` is technically already in a list that contains something like `{"End": {"State": True, "Berry": True}}`
    -- A cleanup function that can convert `{'dump': [{"End": {"State": True, "BGW": True}}, {"End": {"State": True, "Berry": True}}]` into `{'dump': [{"End": {"State": True, "BGW": True, "Berry": True}}]` would fix this bloat risk
- PR #4404 Monoclinic Symmetry Handling Fix by @kavanase
    This issue is related to https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/issues/1929 (for which a patch solution was added that fixed one case of this occurrence, but not in general).
    When handling monoclinic symmetry within `SpacegroupAnalyzer`, the standardisation attempts to reorder the lattice vectors depending on whether the alpha angle is >90 degrees or <90 degrees. If it is exactly 90 degrees, it defaults to the original lattice, however there was an issue with this implementation where it assumed that the beta and gamma angles were also 90 degrees (and so set the lattice matrix as `[[a, 0, 0], [0, b, 0], [0, 0, c]]`), which may not (and in most cases should not) be the case.
    This was causing weird behaviour for me where the volume of the primitive structures being returned by `SpacegroupAnalyzer` was different to `Structure.find_primitive()` (by a non-integer factor). I've added a test for this case, and also confirmed that the general implementation here works for the failure case noted in https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/issues/1929
- PR #4406 `UFloat` update by @kavanase
    This is a minor addition to https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/pull/4400.
    I found that there were some cases where an energy adjustment of `UFloat(0, 0)` were already present in `ComputedEntry.energy_adjustments`, avoiding the updated handling of setting `std_dev` to `np.nan` when it is 0 (and avoiding the `UFloat` warning about `std_dev` being 0).

- PR #4392 Brute force order matcher speedup by @kavanase
    This is a small PR to add a `break_on_tol` option to `BruteForceOrderMatcher`, which allows one to massively speed up the molecule matching in cases where one just cares _if_ the molecules match within a given RMSD (rather than screening over _all_ possible permutations, to get the lowest possible RMSD).
    The speedup factor can be anywhere from 0% to several orders of magnitude, depending on the number of possible permutations and when a matching permutation is found.
    Also includes a small typo fix that for an error message that reference the original class name (in https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/pull/1938) which was later renamed.

- PR #4341 Remove "Electrical resistivity" for Se as "high" by @DanielYang59
    ### Summary
    - Remove "Electrical resistivity" for Se as "high", to fix #4312
    Current the data for Electrical resistivity of Se is "high" (with `10<sup>-8</sup> &Omega; m` as the unit), and our parser would interpret it to:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.core import Element
    print(Element.Se.electrical_resistivity)  # 1e-08 m ohm
    ```
    This is the only data as "high" in `periodic_table.json` AFAIK.
    After this, it would be None with a warning:
    ```
    /Users/yang/developer/pymatgen/debug/test_elements.py:3: UserWarning: No data available for electrical_resistivity for Se
    print(Element.Se.electrical_resistivity)

- PR #4334 Updated Potentials Class in FEFF io to consider radius by @CharlesCardot
    Changed the Potentials class to consider the same radius that is used in
    the Atoms class. This is necessary to avoid a situation where the radius is small enough to only have a subset of the unique elements in a structure, but all the elements have potentials defined, which causes FEFF to fail when run.
    Major changes:
    - fix 1: **Previous behavior**: When creating a FEFFDictset using the feff.io tools, the potentials class defined a potential for every unique element in a structure, while the atoms class defined an atom coordinate for every atom in a radius around the absorbing atom. If the radius was defined to be small, only a subset of the unique atoms in the structure would be included in the atom class. **New behavior**: Updated the potentials class to only create potentials for atoms inside the radius specified when creating a FEFFDictset. Without this, a too small radius for a structure with unique elements outside of that radius would cause FEFF to fail, given that there was a Potential defined for an element that did not exist in the Atoms flag.

- PR #4331 Optimized cube file parsing in from_cube for improved speed by @OliMarc
    # **Summary**
    ### **Major Changes:**
    This PR enhances the `from_cube` function in `io.common.VolumetricData` to significantly improve performance. When processing large `.cube` files, the original implementation took minutes to read and set Pymatgen objects. The optimized version incorporates several key improvements: file reading is now handled with `readlines()` instead of multiple `readline()` calls, reducing I/O operations. Voxel data parsing has been rewritten to use NumPy vectorized parsing instead of loops, making numerical processing faster. Atom site parsing has been improved by replacing the loop-based `readline()` approach with list comprehensions. Additionally, volumetric data parsing now leverages `np.fromstring()` instead of converting lists to NumPy arrays.

## v2024.9.17

- Emergency release to fix broken phase diagram plotting due to completely unnecessary refactoring. (Thanks @yang-ruoxi for fixing.)

## v2024.9.10

💥 **Breaking**: NumPy/Cython integer type changed from `np.long`/`np.int_` to int64 on Windows to align with NumPy 2.x, [changing the default integer type to int64 on Windows 64-bit systems](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/2.0.0-notes.html) in favor of the platform-dependent `np.int_` type.
Recommendation: Please explicitly declare `dtype=np.int64` when initializing a NumPy array if it's passed to a Cythonized pymatgen function like `find_points_in_spheres`. You may also want to test downstream packages with [NumPy 1.x on Windows in CI pipelines](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/depending_on_numpy.html#build-time-dependency).

## v2023.7.17

* Cython 3.0 support.
* PR #3157 from @mattmcdermott magnetic-analyzer-fix. Fixes bug briefly mentioned in #3070, where recent
  spin property changes resulted in the `MagneticStructureEnumerator` failing. This is apparently due to
  creating structures where only some `Species.spin` properties are defined, causing
  CollinearMagneticStructureEnumerator` to fail.
* PR #3070 from @mattmcdermott magnetic-enumerator-fix. To summarize: changes to default magnetic moments
  introduced in #2727 now mean that structures with only partially defined magnetic moments (e.g., on
  half the sites) cannot be successfully analyzed by `SpaceGroupAnalyzer`. This was encountered when
  performing magnetic ordering enumeration, as the previous default behavior for `
MagOrderingTransformation` does not implicitly yield spins of 0 on the nonmagnetic sites. This has now
  been fixed.

## v2023.7.14

* Emergency bug fix release to remove use of sys.path in pymatgen.io.ase package.
* Fix "Incompatible POTCAR" error on ComputedEntries with oxidation states.
* New global config variable `PMG_POTCAR_CHECKS` provides means to disable all POTCAR checking.

## v2023.7.11

* Use joblib to speed up expensive enumeration energy computations.
* Minor cleanups.

## v2023.6.28

* Use lru_cache to speed up get_el_sp by 400x (@v1kko).
* Related to lru_cache of get_el_sp, Species.properties is now deprecated in favor of setting Species(spin=5). The rationale is
  that spin is the only supported property for Species anyway. Species and DummySpecies is now mostly immutable, i.e., setting specie.spin = 5 have no effect. This is as intended since the first version of pymatgen.

* PR #3030 from @lbluque master
  Remove superfluous structure argument docstring from `SQSTransformation` init
* PR #3031 from @kavanase master
  This is a quick fix to allow direct initialisation of the `DictSet` class, which was possible before but broke in <https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/pull/2972> due to the `Yb_2` check querying `self.CONFIG`, which is only defined if `DictSet` was being initialised from a subclass and not directly.

❗ The Yb_2 deprecation release ❗

This release changes the Ytterbium (Yb) pseudo-potential (PSP) from Yb_2 to Yb_3 for all PBE_54 VASP input sets.

Background: The `A-lab <https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2023/04/17/meet-the-autonomous-lab-of-the-future>` revealed that as a result of using Yb_2 the energy on Yb compounds is off by a lot, resulting in supposedly stable things being unsynthesizable. While an unfortunate mistake, it's also great to see how experiment can help surface simulation errors.

On pre-PBE_54 input sets, we now issue a warning that Yb_2 will give bad results for most systems since Yb is most often in oxidation state Yb3+.

Reason: The better fix Yb_3 only became available in the PBE_54 PSP set. Requiring it on pre-PBE_54 input sets would mean you can't run Yb compounds.

For more details see [#2968](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/pull/2968)and [#2969](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/pull/2969).

## v2023.2.22

* PR #2848 from @ml-evs ml-evs/update_optimade_aliases
  Currently `OptimadeRester` defaults to an outdated list of OPTIMADE database URLs (several of which fail) and the design of the class is such that refreshing these aliases can only be done post-init which means they will not be used if the user provides their own filtered list of aliases, without doing some extra work.
  This PR refreshes the vendored list of aliases (which should be much more stable now since their initial addition 2 years ago), and also adds the option to refresh the aliases on initialization of the class.
  This currently affects the pymatgen OPTIMADE tutorials at <https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/optimade-tutorial-exercises>.

* PR #2803 from @amkrajewski add_weightbasedfunctions
  When working with metallic alloys, weight-fraction-based notations such as Ti64 / Ti-6V-4Al or NiTiNOL60 / Ni-40Ti are commonly employed in both industrial specifications and scientific literature. Regardless of the numerous downsides of this situation, including errors in scientific experiments or NLP-parsing when they are mistaken for atomic fractions or chemical formulas, being able to create a Composition object from them (under correct interpretation) would be a useful pymatgen feature.
  * Composition class method to initialize it from a dictionary of weight fractions
  * Composition property giving a dictionary of weight fractions
  * concise tests for the two above were added

## v2022.7.19

This will be the final release with the pymatgen.analysis.defects
module included in the standard pymatgen package. This release will
include the older defects code by default, but can also be replaced with
the newer defects code through installation of pymatgen-analysis-defects.

Subsequent versions of pymatgen will require
the additional installation of `pymatgen-analysis-defects <https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen-analysis-defects>`\_ for all defect-related
functionality via pip install pymatgen-analysis-defects.

Relevant imports will still be from the pymatgen.analysis.defects namespace but the code will now be maintained and developed in this separate repository.

There will be significant changes to the defects code to support new functionality.Existing PyCDT users should use this version of pymatgen or older. Any questions
about this change should be directed to Jimmy-Xuan Shen, @jmmshn.

For more information about other pymatgen "add-on" packages, please see
`this page in our documentation <https://pymatgen.org/addons.html>`\_.

* ASEAtomAdaptor: (1) Updates to magmom support, (2) Oxidation states support, (3) Charges are now passed (@Andrew-S-Rosen)
* Cleanup of deprecated methods. (@janosh)
* Bigfix for gzipped DOSCAR (@JaGeo)
* Updates for QChem Support (@samblau)
* QuantumEspresso k-grid fix input fix. (@vorwerkc)
* `Entry.__repr__()` now outputs name where available. (@janosh)
* Fixes to Vasprun.final_energy to report `e_0_energy` (the desired energy quantity) for VASP 6+. (@Andrew-S-Rosen)
* `Outcar().final_energy` now prints out `e_0_energy` (also called "energy(sigma->0)" in the OUTCAR) rather than `energy_fr_energy` (also called "free energy TOTEN" in the OUTCAR). This is to be consistent with `Vasprun().final_energy` and because it is generally the desired quantity. `Outcar` now has two new attributes: `.final_energy_wo_entrp` and `final_fr_energy`, which correspond to `e_wo_entrp` and `e_fr_energy`, respectively. (@Andrew-S-Rosen)
* Improved parsing of coupled cluster calculations in QChem (@espottesmith).

## v2022.1.8

* First proper new release of 2022 formalizes the switch back to date-based versioning introduced as a temporary measure last year.
* Numpy version pinned to 1.22.0. This is necessary to avoid binary incompatibility.
* With the numpy version, py37 support is dropped.
* ASE io improvements (e.g., magnetic moments and selective dynamics transfer). @Andrew-S-Rosen
* New automatic k-point generation scheme, `automatic_density_by_lengths`, which allows the user to specify a density of k-points in each dimension (rather than just for the entire volume). @Andrew-S-Rosen
* Build improvements to dynamically generate C code by running Cython on pyx files rather than having hard-generated .c files.

  to help new developers write add-ons for pymatgen! Check out our
  :doc:`contributing page</contributing>` for details.

## v2022.0.3

* Another bug fix release! Now SETTINGS have been moved to pymatgen.core.

## v2022.0.2 (Yanked)

* Bug fix release for missing package data files in v2022.0.1

## v2022.0.1 (Yanked)

* `pymatgen`, `pymatgen.ext`, `pymatgen.io` and `pymatgen.analysis` are now
  namespace packages. Note that this does not affect normal usage of pymatgen
  from v2022.0.0. All imports remain the same. However, it does allow developers
  to write "add-ons" to these subpackages. A full documentation with examples
  and templates is in the works to guide developers on how to write these
  packages.

## v2022.0.0 (Yanked)

* This is the new version of pymatgen going forward. Root-level imports have been removed. Please see
  <https://pymatgen.org/compatibility.html> on how to update your code for compatibility with v2022.

## v2021.3.5

* Backwards incompatible changes in v2021.3.4 have been removed. Instead another semantic version v2022.0.0 has been
  released. Future critical bug fixes will be backported to v2021.x.x, but the main line of development will occur on
  v2022.0.0 onwards.

## v2021.3.4 (Yanked)

* **Backwards incompatible**: Pymatgen root imports have been removed from
  v2021.3.4 in preparation for a change to a more modular, extensible
  architecture that will allow more developers to contribute.

  If your existing code uses `from pymatgen import <something>`, you will need to make
  modifications. The easiest way is to use an IDE to run a Search and Replace.
  First, replace any `from pymatgen import MPRester` with
  `from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester`. Then, replace
  `from pymatgen import` with `from pymatgen.core import`. Alternatively, if you
  are using a Mac command line, you can do::

  find . -name '_.py' | xargs sed -i "" 's/from pymatgen import MPRester/from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester/g'
  find . -name '_.py' | xargs sed -i "" 's/from pymatgen import/from pymatgen.core import/g'

  From a Linux command line, you can do::

  find . -name '_.py' | xargs sed -i 's/from pymatgen import MPRester/from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester/g'
  find . -name '_.py' | xargs sed -i 's/from pymatgen import/from pymatgen.core import/g'

  This should resolve most import errors and only a few more modifications may
  need to be done by hand.

  Specifically, the following "convenience imports" have been removed in favor of
  their canonical import::

  from pymatgen import Composition # now "from pymatgen.core.composition import Composition"
  from pymatgen import Lattice # now "from pymatgen.core.lattice import Lattice"
  from pymatgen import SymmOp # now "from pymatgen.core.operations import SymmOp"
  from pymatgen import DummySpecie, DummySpecies, Element, Specie, Species # now "from pymatgen.core.periodic_table ..."
  from pymatgen import PeriodicSite, Site # now "from pymatgen.core.sites ..."
  from pymatgen import IMolecule, IStructure, Molecule, Structure # now "from pymatgen.core.structure ..."
  from pymatgen import ArrayWithUnit, FloatWithUnit, Unit # now "from pymatgen.core.units ..."
  from pymatgen import Orbital, Spin # now "from pymatgen.electronic_structure.core ..."
  from pymatgen import MPRester # now "from pymatgen.ext.matproj ..."

## v2021.3.3

* **Backwards incompatible**: pymatgen.SETTINGS have been moved to
  pymatgen.settings.SETTINGS. In general, this should not lead to many breakages
  since most of these settings are used within pymatgen itself.
* **Backwards incompatible**: pymatgen.loadfn and get_structure_from_mp have been
  removed since no one was using them.
* critic2_caller has been refactored. (@samblau)

* Improved nwchemio supports COSMO and ESP calculations (Nav Rajput).

## v2.8.0

* **Units**. Pymatgen now has a new system of managing units,
  defined in pymatgen.core.units. Typical energy, length, time,
  temperature and charge units are supported. Units subclass float,
  which makes the usage transparent in all functions. The value that they
  being are in terms of conversions between different units and addition and
  subtraction of different units of the same type. Some basic quantities
  like ionic radii and atomic masses are now returned in unitized forms for
  easy conversion. Please see :mod:`pymatgen.core.units` and the
  :doc:`examples </examples>` for a demonstration of house to use units in
  pymatgen.
* **Minor backwards-incompatible change**. Structures are now sorted by
  default when generating VASP input files using vaspio_set. Old behavior can
  be obtained by setting sort_structure=False in the constructor. This is
  typically the desired behavior and prevents the generation of large
  POTCARs when atomic species are not grouped together.

  and Shyue Ping Ong).

## v2.7.2

* Minor bug fix release to fix some rare errors in very high dimensional
  phase diagrams. **Requires new pyhull version (1.3.8).**

## v2.7.1

* **Major backwards-incompatible change.** With effect from v2.7.1,
  the default Structure and Molecule classes are now _mutable_ objects. All
  functionality in the :mod:`pymatgen.core.structure_modifier` has been
  ported over to the new mutable classes. This change was implemented
  because the immutability of Structure and Molecule has resulted in very
  awkward code to make changes to them. The main cost of this change is that
  Structure and Molecule can no longer be used as dict keys (**hash** has
  been set to None). However, we believe this is a minor cost given that we
  have rarely seen the use of Structure or Molecule as dict keys in any case.
  For the rare instances where such functionality is needed,
  we have provided the IStructure and IMolecule classes (where I indicates
  immutability) which will perform exactly the same way as the previous
  classes. With this change, the :mod:`pymatgen.core.structure_modifier`
  module is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
* read_structure and write_structure now supports pymatgen's JSON-serialized
  structures.
* read_mol and write_mol functions now available (analogues of
  read_structure and write_structure for molecules)

* Bug fix for StructureMatcher.
* Miscellaneous speedups.

## v2.4.0

* New StructureMatcher that effectively replaces StructureFitter. Orders of
  magnitude faster and more robust. StructureFitter is now deprecated.
* Vastly improved PrimitiveCellTransformation.
* A lot of core methods have been rewritten to take advantage of vectorization
  in numpy, resulting in orders of magnitude improvement in speed.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes and speedups.

## v2.3.2

* More utilities for working with Periodic Boundary Conditions.
* Improved MPRester that supports more data and a new method of specifying
  the API key for heavy users via a MAPI_KEY environment variable. Please
  refer to the :doc:`usage pages </usage>` for more information.
* Vastly improved POTCAR setup script in scripts directly that is now
  installed as part of a default pymatgen installation.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes and speedups.

## v2.3.1

* Significant improvements to the high-level interface to the Materials API.
  New interface provides more options to make it easier to get structures and
  entries, better warnings and error handling. It uses the _requests_
  library for a cleaner API.
* Bug fix for VolumetricData parsing and methods such as CHGCAR and LOCPOT.
  Previously, the parsing was done incorrectly because VASP actually provides
  data by running through the x-axis first, followed by y, then z.
* Bug fix for reverse_readline so that it works for gzipped and bzipped
  structures (courtesy of Anubhav Jain).
* Fix "lossy" composition to_dict method. Now composition.to_dict properly
  returns a correct species string as a key for compositions using species,
  instead of just the element symbols.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

## v2.3.0

* Remove usage of scipy and external qhull callers. Now uses pyhull package.
  Please note that this change implies that the pyhull package is now a
  required dependency. If you install pymatgen through the usual
  easy_install or pip install methods, this should be taken care of
  automatically for you. Otherwise, please look for the pyhull package on
  PyPI to download and install it.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

## v2.2.6

* Brand new _beta_ bond valence analyzer based on a Maximum A Posteriori
  algo using data-mined ICSD data.
* Speed up and improvements to core classes.
* Improved structure fitter (credits to Geoffroy Hautier).
* Brand new entry_tools module (pymatgen.entries.entry_tools).
* Vastly improved Outcar parser based on reverse parsing that speeds up
  reading of OUTCAR files by orders of magnitude.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

## v2.2.4

* Fixed bug in hexagonal cell KPOINTS file generation.
* New RelaxationAnalyzer to compare structures.
* New _beta_ bond valence analyzer.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

## v2.2.3

* New filter framework for filtering structures in pymatgen.alchemy.
* Updated feff io classes to support FEFF 9.6 and other code improvements.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

* Miscellaneous bug fixes and speed improvements.

## v2.2.0

* Beta modules (pymatgen.io.feffio) for io for FEFF, courtesy of Alan Dozier.
* New smartio module that intelligently reads structure input files based on
  file extension.
* Spglib_adaptor module has been renamed to finder for brevity.
* Upgraded spglib to version 1.2.2. Improved handling of spglib install on
  Mac OS X and Solaris.
* Major cleanup of code for PEP8 compliance.
* Cssr module now supports reading of input files.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes and speed improvements.

## v2.1.2

* Brand new CompoundPD class that allows the plotting of phase diagrams that
  do not have elements as their terminal points.
* Spglib is now completely integrated as part of the setup.py installation.
* Major (but completely backwards compatible) refactoring of sites and vaspio.
* Added a EnumerateStructureTransformation with optional dependency on the enum
  library by Gus Hart. This provides a robust way to enumerate derivative
  structures,
* Implemented LLL lattice reduction algorithm. Also added option to sanitize
  a Structure on copy.
* Bug fix for missing Compatibility file in release distribution.
* Vastly improved StructureFitter which performs cell reduction where necessary
  to speed up fitting.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes and speed improvements.

## v2.0.0

* Brand new module (pymatgen.matproj.rest) for interfacing with the
  MaterialsProject REST interface.
* Useful aliases for commonly used Objects, similar in style to numpy.
  Supported objects include Element, Composition, Structure, Molecule, Spin
  and Orbital. For example, the following will now work::

      import pymatgen as mg
      # Elemental Si
      fe = mg.Element("Si")
      # Composition of Fe2O3
      comp = mg.Composition("Fe2O3")
      # CsCl structure
      structure = mg.Structure(mg.Lattice.cubic(4.2), ["Cs", "Cl"],
                               [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]])

* New PDAnalyzer method to generate chemical potential maps.
* Enhanced POSCAR class to support parsing of velocities and more formatting
  options.
* Reorganization of Bandstructure module. Beta support for projected
  bandstructure and eigenvalues in vaspio and electronic_structure.
