Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. These are some
of the main features:

1. Highly flexible classes for the representation of Element, Site, Molecule, Structure objects.
2. Extensive input/output support, including support for [VASP](http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/),
   [ABINIT](http://www.abinit.org/), CIF, Gaussian, XYZ, and many other file formats.
3. Powerful analysis tools, including generation of phase diagrams, Pourbaix diagrams, diffusion analyses,
   reactions, etc.
4. Electronic structure analyses, such as density of states and band structure.
5. Integration with the Materials Project REST API, Crystallography Open Database and other external data sources.

As of 2022, pymatgen only supports Python 3.9 and above. Our support schedule follows closely that of the Scientific
Python software stack, i.e., when packages such as numpy drops support for Python versions, we will drop support for
newer versions. Similarly, support for new Python versions will be adopted only when most of the core dependencies
support the new Python versions.

Pymatgen is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your own contributions.
These contributions can be in the form of additional tools or modules you develop, or feature requests and bug
reports. The following are resources for pymatgen:

- [Official documentation](https://pymatgen.org)
- Bug reports or feature requests: Please submit an issue on [Github Issues].
- Code contributions via pull requests are welcome.
- For questions that are not bugs or feature requests, please use the [pymatgen MatSci forum] or open a [GitHub
  discussion].
- [matgenb] provides some example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use pymatgen functionality.
- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pymatgen) to get news and tips.

## Why use pymatgen?

1. **It is (fairly) robust.** Pymatgen is used by thousands of researchers and is the analysis code powering the
   [Materials Project]. The analysis it produces survives rigorous scrutiny every single day. Bugs tend to be found
   and corrected quickly. Pymatgen also uses Github Actions for continuous integration, which ensures that every new
   code passes a comprehensive suite of unit tests.
2. **It is well documented.** A fairly comprehensive documentation has been written to help you get to grips with it
   quickly.
3. **It is open.** You are free to use and contribute to pymatgen. It also means that pymatgen is continuously
   being improved. We will attribute any code you contribute to any publication you specify. Contributing to
   pymatgen means your research becomes more visible, which translates to greater impact.
4. **It is fast.** Many of the core numerical methods in pymatgen have been optimized by vectorizing in
   `numpy`/`scipy`. This means that coordinate manipulations are fast. Pymatgen also comes with a complete system
   for handling periodic boundary conditions.
5. **It will be around.** Pymatgen is not a pet research project. It is used in the well-established Materials
   Project. It is also actively being developed and maintained by the [Materials Virtual Lab], the ABINIT group and
   many other research groups.
6. **A growing ecosystem of developers and add-ons**. Pymatgen has contributions from materials scientists all over
   the world. We also now have an architecture to support add-ons that expand pymatgen's functionality even
   further. Check out the [contributing page](/contributing) and [add-ons page](/addons) for details and examples.

    *The code is mightier than the pen.*

## Matgenie & Examples

The [Materials Virtual Lab] has created a [matgenb] repository of Jupyter notebooks for
common and advanced use cases. One of the ways you can contribute is to fork the matgenb repo and add your own examples.

Below are a quick look at some of the graphical output possible.

## Getting pymatgen

### Conda (recommended)

If you are absolutely new to Python and/or are using Windows, the easiest
installation process is using [conda](http://conda.pydata.org). If you
already have conda installed, pymatgen can be installed from the [conda-forge
channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) using the following command:

```shell
conda install --channel conda-forge pymatgen
```

Note that you might need to ensure a relatively recent version of gcc is
available to compile pymatgen. You can use conda to get that::

```shell
conda install gcc
```

Pymatgen is under active development, and new features are added regularly. To
upgrade pymatgen to the latest version, use the following command:

```shell
conda upgrade pymatgen
```

Step-by-step instructions for all platforms are available at the
[installation page](/installation).

### pip

The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable
release that is relatively bug-free. The easiest way to install pymatgen on
any system is to use pip:

```shell
pip install pymatgen
```

Wheels for Mac and Windows have been built for convenience. Similarly, you might
need to ensure you have a relatively recent version of gcc.

To upgrade pymatgen via pip:

```shell
pip install --upgrade pymatgen
```

The bleeding edge developmental version is at the pymatgen [Github repo]. The developmental
version is likely to be more buggy, but may contain new features. The Github version include complete test files.
After cloning the source, you can type in the root of the repo:

```shell
pip install .
```

or to install the package in developmental mode:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

Detailed installation instructions, including installation of optional dependencies, set up for POTCAR generation,
Materials Project REST interface usage, setup for developers, etc. are given on this [page](/installation).

For some extras, you can also install the optional dependencies using:

```shell
pip install pymatgen[extra]
```

For an always up-to-date list of extras, consult the [setup.py's extras_require](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/master/setup.py).

### Shared cluster installation

If you are installing pymatgen on shared computing clusters, e.g., the XSEDE
or NERSC resources in the US, the best way is to use conda to perform a local
install. This guarantees the right version of python and all dependencies:

```shell
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b

# Reload bash profile.
source $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bash_profile

# Install numpy and other pydata stack packages via conda.
conda install --yes numpy scipy pandas
conda install --yes --channel conda-forge pymatgen
```

## Usage

![pymatgen overview](assets/overview.jpg)
*Overview of a typical workflow for pymatgen.*

The figure above provides an overview of the functionality in pymatgen. A typical workflow would involve a user
converting data (structure, calculations, etc.) from various sources (first principles calculations, crystal and
molecule input files, Materials Project, etc.) into Python objects using pymatgen's io packages, which are then used to
perform further structure manipulation or analyses.

### Quick start

Here are some quick examples of the core capabilities and objects:

```python
import pymatgen.core as pmg

# Integrated symmetry analysis tools from spglib
from pymatgen.symmetry.analyzer import SpacegroupAnalyzer

si = pmg.Element("Si")
si.atomic_mass  # 28.0855
print(si.melting_point)
# 1687.0 K

comp = pmg.Composition("Fe2O3")
comp.weight  # 159.6882
# Note that Composition conveniently allows strings to be treated just like an Element object.
comp["Fe"]  # 2.0
comp.get_atomic_fraction("Fe")  # 0.4
lattice = pmg.Lattice.cubic(4.2)
structure = pmg.Structure(lattice, ["Cs", "Cl"], ...[[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]])
# structure.volume
# 74.088000000000008
# structure[0]
# PeriodicSite: Cs (0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000) [0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000]

# You can create a Structure using spacegroup symmetry as well.
li2o = pmg.Structure.from_spacegroup(
    "Fm-3m", pmg.Lattice.cubic(3), ["Li", "O"], [[0.25, 0.25, 0.25], [0, 0, 0]]
)

finder = SpacegroupAnalyzer(structure)
finder.get_space_group_symbol()
"Pm-3m"

# Convenient IO to various formats. You can specify various formats.
# Without a filename, a string is returned. Otherwise,
# the output is written to the file. If only the filename is provided,
# the format is intelligently determined from a file.
structure.to(fmt="poscar")
structure.to(filename="POSCAR")
structure.to(filename="CsCl.cif")

# Reading a structure is similarly easy.
structure = pmg.Structure.from_str(open("CsCl.cif").read(), fmt="cif")
structure = pmg.Structure.from_file("CsCl.cif")

# Reading and writing a molecule from a file. Supports XYZ and
# Gaussian input and output by default. Support for many other
# formats via the optional openbabel dependency (if installed).
methane = pmg.Molecule.from_file("methane.xyz")
methane.to("methane.gjf")

# Pythonic API for editing Structures and Molecules (v2.9.1 onwards)
# Changing the specie of a site.
structure[1] = "F"
print(structure)
# Structure Summary (Cs1 F1)
# Reduced Formula: CsF

# Changes species and coordinates (fractional assumed for structures)
structure[1] = "Cl", [0.51, 0.51, 0.51]
print(structure)
# Structure Summary (Cs1 Cl1)
# Reduced Formula: CsCl
# abc   :   4.200000   4.200000   4.200000

# Replaces all K in the structure with K: 0.5, Na: 0.5, i.e.,
# a disordered structure is created.
structure["K"] = "K0.5Na0.5"
print(structure)
# Full Formula (K0.5 Na0.5 Cl1)
# Reduced Formula: K0.5Na0.5Cl1
# abc   :   4.209000   4.209000   4.209000

#   1  Cl                 0.5  0.5  0.5

# Because structure is like a list, it supports most list-like methods
# such as sort, reverse, etc.
structure.reverse()
print(structure)
# Structure Summary (Cs1 Cl1)
# Reduced Formula: CsCl
# abc   :   4.200000   4.200000   4.200000

# 2 Cs     0.000000     0.000000     0.000000

# Molecules function similarly, but with Site and Cartesian coords.
# The following changes the C in CH4 to an N and displaces it by 0.01A
# in the x-direction.
methane[0] = "N", [0.01, 0, 0]
```

The above illustrates only the most basic capabilities of pymatgen. Users are
strongly encouraged to explore the [usage pages](/usage).

### API documentation

For detailed documentation of all modules and classes, please refer to the
[API docs](/pymatgen).

### More resources

The founder and maintainer of pymatgen, Shyue Ping Ong, has conducted several
workshops (together with Anubhav Jain) on how to effectively use pymatgen (as
well as the extremely useful [custodian] error management and [FireWorks]
workflow software. The slides for these workshops are available on the
[Materials Virtual Lab].

### `pmg` command line interface

To demonstrate the capabilities of pymatgen and to make it easy for users to
quickly use the functionality, pymatgen comes with a set of useful scripts
that utilize the library to perform all kinds of analyses. These are
installed to your path by default when you install pymatgen through the
typical installation routes.

Here, we will discuss the most versatile of these scripts, known as
pmg. The typical usage of pmg is:

```shell
pmg {setup, config, analyze, plotdos, plotchgint, convert, symm, view, compare} additional_arguments
```

At any time, you can use `pmg --help` or `pmg subcommand --help` to bring up a useful help message on how to use
these subcommands. Here are a few examples of typical usages:

```bash
# Parses all vasp runs in a directory and display the basic energy
# information. Saves the data in a file called vasp_data.gz for subsequent
# reuse.

pmg analyze .

# Plot the dos from the vasprun.xml file.

pmg plot --dos vasprun.xml

# Convert between file formats. The script attempts to intelligently
# determine the file type. Input file types supported include CIF,
# vasprun.xml, POSCAR, CSSR. You can force the script to assume certain file
# types by specifying additional arguments. See pmg convert -h.

pmg structure --convert --filenames input_filename output_filename.

# Obtain spacegroup information using a tolerance of 0.1 angstroms.

pmg structure --symmetry 0.1 --filenames filename1 filename2

# Visualize a structure. Requires VTK to be installed.

pmg view filename

# Compare two structures for similarity

pmg structure --group element --filenames filename1 filename2

# Generate a POTCAR with symbols Li_sv O and the PBE functional

pmg potcar --symbols Li_sv O --functional PBE

```

### Add-ons

Some add-ons are available for pymatgen today:

1. The [pymatgen-db](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymatgen-db) add-on
   provides tools to create databases of calculated run data using pymatgen.
2. The [custodian] package provides a JIT job management and error correction for calculations and is used by the
   Materials Project for high-throughput calculations.
3. [pymatgen-analysis-diffusion](http://pypi.org/project/pymatgen-analysis-diffusion/) by the [Materials Virtual Lab]
   provides modules for diffusion analysis, including path determination for NEB calculations, analysis of MD
   trajectories (RDF, van Hove, Arrhenius plots, etc.)

A comprehensive listing is provided at the [addons page](/addons).

## Contributing

Pymatgen is developed by a team of volunteers. It is started by a team comprising of MIT and Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory staff to be a robust toolkit for materials researchers to perform advanced manipulations of structures and
analyses.

For pymatgen to continue to grow in functionality and robustness, we rely on other volunteers to develop new analyses
and report and fix bugs. We welcome anyone to use our code as-is, but if you could take a few moment to give back
to pymatgen in some small way, it would be greatly appreciated. A benefit of contributing is that your code will now be
used by other researchers who use pymatgen, and we will include an acknowledgement to you (and any related
publications) in pymatgen.

### Reporting bugs

A simple way that anyone can contribute is simply to report bugs and issues to the developing team. Please report
any bugs and issues at pymatgen's [Github Issues]. For help with any pymatgen issue, consult [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pymatgen)
and if you cannot find an answer, please post a question on the [pymatgen MatSci forum].

### Developing new functionality

Another way to contribute is to submit new code/bugfixes to pymatgen. The best way for anyone to develop pymatgen is
by adopting the collaborative Github workflow (see [contributing page](/contributing).
