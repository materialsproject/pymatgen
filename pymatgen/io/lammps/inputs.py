class LammpsInputFile(InputFile):
    """
    Class representing a LAMMPS input settings file, e.g. in.lammps.
    Allows for LAMMPS input generation in line/stage wise manner. A stage
    here is defined as a block of LAMMPS input commands usually performing a
    specific task during the simulation such as energy minimization or
    NPT/NVT runs. But more broadly, a stage can also be a block of LAMMPS
    input where the simulation box is set up, a set of variables are declared or
    quantities are computed.

    The LammpsInputFile is defined by the attribute `stages`,
    i.e. a list of dicts each with keys `stage_name` and `commands`,
    defining the stage names and the corresponding LAMMPS input settings (list of tuples of two strings each).
    The structure is the following:
    ```
    stages = [
        {"stage_name": "Stage 1", "commands": [(cmd1, args1), (cmd2, args2)]},
        {"stage_name": "Stage 2", "commands": [(cmd3, args3)]}
    ]
    ```
    where cmd's are the LAMMPS command names (e.g., "units", or "pair_coeff")
    and the args are the corresponding arguments.
    "Stage 1" and "Stage 2" are examples of stage names.
