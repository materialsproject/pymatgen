Objects and methods to contact the resource manager to get info on the status of the job and useful statistics.
Note that this is not a wrapper for the C API but a collection of simple wrappers around the shell commands
provided by the resource manager  (qsub, qdel and qstat for PBS, sinfo, squeue... for Slurm).
The main goal indeed is providing a simplified common interface for different resource managers without
having to rely on external libraries.

    JOB STATE CODES
       Jobs typically pass through several states in the course of their execution.  The typical  states  are
       PENDING, RUNNING, SUSPENDED, COMPLETING, and COMPLETED.  An explanation of each state follows.

    BF  BOOT_FAIL       Job  terminated  due  to launch failure, typically due to a hardware failure (e.g.
                        unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).
    CA  CANCELLED       Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator.
                        The job may or may not have been initiated.
    CD  COMPLETED       Job has terminated all processes on all nodes.
    CF  CONFIGURING     Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use (e.g. booting).
    CG  COMPLETING      Job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some  nodes may still be active.
    F   FAILED          Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition.
    NF  NODE_FAIL       Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.
    PD  PENDING         Job is awaiting resource allocation.
    PR  PREEMPTED       Job terminated due to preemption.
    R   RUNNING         Job currently has an allocation.
    S   SUSPENDED       Job has an allocation, but execution has been suspended.
    TO  TIMEOUT         Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.
    SE SPECIAL_EXIT     The job was requeued in a special state. This state can be set by users, typically
                        in EpilogSlurmctld, if the job has terminated with a particular exit value.
