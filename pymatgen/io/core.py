This module defines the abstract interface for reading and writing calculation
inputs in pymatgen. The interface comprises a 3-tiered hierarchy of clases.

1. An InputFile object represents the contents of a single input file, e.g.
   the INCAR. This class standardizes file read and write operations.
2. An InputSet is a dict-like container that maps filenames (keys) to file
   contents (either strings or InputFile objects). This class provides a standard
   write_input() method.
3. InputGenerator classes implement a get_input_set method that, when provided
   with a structure, return an InputSet object with all parameters set correctly.
   Calculation input files can be written to disk with the write_inputs method.

If you want to implement a new InputGenerator, please take note of the following:

1. You must implement a get_input_set method that returns an InputSet
2. All customization of calculation parameters should be done in the __init__
   method of the InputGenerator. The idea is that the generator contains
   the "recipe", but nothing that is specific to a particular system. get_input_set
   takes system-specific information (such as structure) and applies the recipe.
3. All InputGenerator must save all supplied args and kwargs as instance variables.
   E.g., self.my_arg = my_arg and self.kwargs = kwargs in the __init__. This
   ensures the as_dict and from_dict work correctly.
