    This class implements the Materials Project mixing scheme, which allows mixing of
    energies from different DFT functionals. Note that this should only be used for
    VASP calculations using the MaterialsProject parameters (e.g. MPRelaxSet or
    MPScanRelaxSet). Using this compatibility scheme on runs with different parameters
    may lead to unexpected results.

    This is the scheme used by the Materials Project to generate Phase Diagrams containing
    a mixture of GGA(+U) and R2SCAN calculations. However in principle it can be used to
    mix energies from any two functionals.

        Instantiate the mixing scheme. The init method creates a generator class that
        contains relevant settings (e.g., StructureMatcher instance, Compatibility settings
        for each functional) for processing groups of entries.

        Args:
            structure_matcher (StructureMatcher): StructureMatcher object used to determine
                whether calculations from different functionals describe the same material.
            run_type_1: The first DFT run_type. Typically this is the majority or run type or
                the "base case" onto which the other calculations are referenced. Valid choices
                are any run_type recognized by Vasprun.run_type, such as "LDA", "GGA", "GGA+U",
                "PBEsol", "SCAN", or "R2SCAN". The class will ignore any entries that have a
                run_type different than run_type_1 or run_type_2.

                The list of run_type_1 entries provided to process_entries MUST form a complete
                Phase Diagram in order for the mixing scheme to work. If this condition is not
                satisfied, processing the entries will fail.

                Note that the special string "GGA(+U)" (default) will treat both GGA and GGA+U
                calculations as a single type. This option exists because GGA/GGA+U mixing is
                already handled by MaterialsProject2020Compatibility.
            run_type_2: The second DFT run_type. Typically this is the run_type that is 'preferred'
                but has fewer calculations. If run_type_1 and run_type_2 calculations exist for all
                materials, run_type_2 energies will be used (hence the 'preferred' status). The class
                will ignore any entries that have a run_type different than run_type_1 or run_type_2.
            compat_1: Compatibility class used to pre-process entries of run_type_1.
                Defaults to MaterialsProjectCompatibility2020.
            compat_2: Compatibility class used to pre-process entries of run_type_2.
                Defaults to None.
            fuzzy_matching: Whether to use less strict structure matching logic for
                diatomic elements O2, N2, F2, H2, and Cl2 as well as I and Br. Outputs of DFT
                relaxations using
                different functionals frequently fail to structure match for these elements
                even though they come from the same original material. Fuzzy structure matching
                considers the materials equivalent if the formula, number of sites, and
                space group are all identical. If there are multiple materials of run_type_2
                that satisfy these criteria, the one with lowest energy is considered to
                match.
