class XRDCalculator(AbstractDiffractionPatternCalculator):
    r"""
    Computes the XRD pattern of a crystal structure.

    This code is implemented by Shyue Ping Ong as part of UCSD's NANO106 -
    Crystallography of Materials. The formalism for this code is based on
    that given in Chapters 11 and 12 of Structure of Materials by Marc De
    Graef and Michael E. McHenry. This takes into account the atomic
    scattering factors and the Lorentz polarization factor, but not
    the Debye-Waller (temperature) factor (for which data is typically not
    available). Note that the multiplicity correction is not needed since
    this code simply goes through all reciprocal points within the limiting
    sphere, which includes all symmetrically equivalent facets. The algorithm
    is as follows

    1. Calculate reciprocal lattice of structure. Find all reciprocal points
       within the limiting sphere given by :math:` \frac{2}{ \lambda}`.

    2. For each reciprocal point :math:` \mathbf{g_{hkl}}` corresponding to
       lattice plane :math:`(hkl)`, compute the Bragg condition
       :math:` \sin( \theta) =  \frac{ \lambda}{2d_{hkl}}`

    3. Compute the structure factor as the sum of the atomic scattering
       factors. The atomic scattering factors are given by

       .. math::

           f(s) = Z - 41.78214 \times s^2 \times \sum \limits_{i=1}^n a_i \
            \exp(-b_is^2)

       where :math:`s = \ frac{\ sin(\ theta)}{\ lambda}` and :math:`a_i`
       and :math:`b_i` are the fitted parameters for each element. The
       structure factor is then given by

       .. math::

           F_{hkl} =  \sum \limits_{j=1}^N f_j  \exp(2 \pi i  \mathbf{g_{hkl}}
            \cdot  \mathbf{r})

    4. The intensity is then given by the modulus square of the structure
       factor.

       .. math::

           I_{hkl} = F_{hkl}F_{hkl}^*

    5. Finally, the Lorentz polarization correction factor is applied. This
       factor is given by:

       .. math::

           P( \theta) =  \frac{1 +  \cos^2(2 \theta)}
           { \sin^2( \theta) \cos( \theta)}
