The ÈÅì of Pymatgen

1.  Great code enables great materials science.
2.  Comprehensive tests ensure robustness.
3.  Clear documentation leads to more usage.
4.  More usage improves code quality (and increases citations).
5.  Even complex scientific ideas can be broken down into simple interfaces.
6.  Though deep (Hulk-level) understanding is often necessary to develop the right interface design.
7.  Slow and accurate is better than fast and wrong.
8.  But efficiency matters for core classes.
9.  The law of thermodynamics apply: code entropy always increases in a closed system.
10. Constant refactoring is the hallmark of an open platform.
