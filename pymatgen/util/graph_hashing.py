    The function iteratively aggregates and hashes neighborhoods of each node.

    Hashes are identical for isomorphic graphs and strong guarantees that
    non-isomorphic graphs will get different hashes. See [1]_ for details.

    If no node or edge attributes are provided, the degree of each node
    is used as its initial label.

    Args:
        G: graph
            The graph to be hashed.
            Can have node and/or edge attributes. Can also have no attributes.
        edge_attr: string, default=None

    Returns:
        h : string
            Hexadecimal string corresponding to hash of the input graph.

        To return the WL hashes of each subgraph of a graph, use

    Return a dictionary of subgraph hashes by node.

    The dictionary is keyed by node to a list of hashes in increasingly
    sized induced subgraphs containing the nodes within 2*k edges
    of the key node for increasing integer k until all nodes are included.

    The function iteratively aggregates and hashes neighborhoods of each node.
    This is achieved for each step by replacing for each node its label from
    the previous iteration with its hashed 1-hop neighborhood aggregate.
    The new node label is then appended to a list of node labels for each
    node.

    To aggregate neighborhoods at each step for a node $n$, all labels of
    nodes adjacent to $n$ are concatenated. If the `edge_attr` parameter is set,
    labels for each neighboring node are prefixed with the value of this attribute
    along the connecting edge from this neighbor to node $n$. The resulting string
    is then hashed to compress this information into a fixed digest size.

    Thus, at the $i$th iteration nodes within $2i$ distance influence any given
    hashed node label. We can therefore say that at depth $i$ for node $n$
    we have a hash for a subgraph induced by the $2i$-hop neighborhood of $n$.

    Can be used to to create general Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, or
    generate features for graphs or nodes, for example to generate 'words' in a
    graph as seen in the 'graph2vec' algorithm.
    See [1]_ & [2]_ respectively for details.

    Hashes are identical for isomorphic subgraphs and there exist strong
    guarantees that non-isomorphic graphs will get different hashes.
    See [1]_ for details.

    If no node or edge attributes are provided, the degree of each node
    is used as its initial label.
    Otherwise, node and/or edge labels are used to compute the hash.

    Args:
        G: graph
            The graph to be hashed.
            Can have node and/or edge attributes. Can also have no attributes.
        edge_attr: string, default=None
            The key in edge attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
            If None, edge labels are ignored.
        node_attr: string, default=None
            The key in node attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
            If None, and no edge_attr given, use the degrees of the nodes as labels.
        iterations: int, default=3
            Number of neighbor aggregations to perform.
            Should be larger for larger graphs.
        digest_size: int, default=16
            Size (in bits) of blake2b hash digest to use for hashing node labels.
            The default size is 16 bits

    Returns:
        node_subgraph_hashes : dict
            A dictionary with each key given by a node in G, and each value given
            by the subgraph hashes in order of depth from the key node.

    Notes:
        To hash the full graph when subgraph hashes are not needed, use
        `weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash` for efficiency.

        Similarity between hashes does not imply similarity between graphs.
