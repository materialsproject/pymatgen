@ \section{Introduction}

This file implements a general CIF reading/writing utility.  The basic
objects ([[CifFile/CifBlock/CifLoopBlock]]) read and write syntactically 
correct CIF 1.1 files
including save frames.  Objects for validating CIFs are built on these
basic objects: A [[CifDic]] object is derived from a [[CifFile]] created from a
DDL1/2 dictionary; and the [[ValidCifFile/ValidCifBlock]] objects allow
creation/checking of CIF files against a list of Cif dictionaries.

The [[CifFile]] class is initialised with either no arguments (a new CIF file) 
or with the name of an already existing CIF file.  Data items are 
accessed/changed/added using the python mapping type ie to get 
[[dataitem]] you would type [[value = cf[blockname][dataitem]]]. 

The methods available for the CifFile type are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [[ReadCif(filename)]]: (re)initialise using Cif file [[filename]]. Filename may be a URL.
\item [[NewBlock(blockname,[block contents],replace=False)]]: add new block to this object.  If [[blockcontents]] is provided, it
must be a [[CifBlock]] object (see below).  If replace is [[False]], attempts to
replace a pre-existing block will cause an error.
\item [[WriteOut(comment)]]: return the contents of the current file as a
CIF-conformant string, with optional [[comment]] at the beginning.
\end{enumerate}

Some of the more useful methods available for the CifBlock type are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [[AddCifItem(data)]]: add [[data]] to the current block.  [[data]] is 
a tuple containing either an array of itemnames and an array of arrays of 
data, or else an itemname and a data value for that item.  This method 
is called when setting data using [], but can be called directly and can
take multiple datanames and values in the [[data]] tuple.
\item [[RemoveCifItem(dataname)]]: remove the given Cif dataname from the 
current block.  Same as typing [['del block[item]']]
\item [[GetLoop(dataname)]]: for looped data item [[dataname]], return the
[[CifLoopBlock]] containing [[dataname]]. 
\item [[AddLoop(dataname,data)]]: add [[data]] to the loop containing
[[dataname]].  If dataname is not a looped item, an error is returned.
If (data) has the wrong length, an error is returned. 
\item [[AddDictionary(dicname)]]: add [[dicname]] to the list of dictionaries
which this datablock conforms to.
\end{enumerate}

Note also that a CifFile object can be accessed as a mapping type, ie using
square brackets.  Most mapping operations have been implemented (see below).

We import type objects at the module level, as required by later versions
of Python.

We build upon the objects defined in the StarFile class, by imposing a few
extra restrictions where necessary.  We need a parallel CIF object at every
level, as we must catch data name lengths and nested loops however the user
wishes to do them.

@ \section{CifFile}

A CifFile is subclassed from a StarFile.  Our StarFile class has an
optional check of line length, which we use.

A CifFile object is a dictionary of
CifBlock objects, accessed by block name.  As the maximum line length
is subject to change, we allow the length to be specified, with the
current default set at 2048 characters (Cif 1.1).  For reading in files, 
we only
flag a length error if the parameter [[strict]] is true, in which case
we use parameter [[maxinlength]] as our maximum line length on input.  
Parameter [[maxoutlength]] sets the maximum line size for output.  If
[[maxoutlength]] is not specified, it defaults to the maximum input
length.

Note that this applies to the input only.  For changing output length, 
you can provide an optional parameter in the [[WriteOut]] method.

<<Initialise data structures>>

@ When initialising, we add those parts that are unique to the CifFile as
opposed to a simple collection of blocks - i.e. reading in from a file,
and some line length restrictions.  We don't indent this section in this
noweb file, so that our comment characters output at the beginning of the
line.   We restrict our blocks to be of type CifBlock.

@ \section{Cif Loop block class}

This parallels the fundamental LoopBlock class of a StarFile, with the
two restrictions that nested loops are not allowed, and data names have
to be no longer than 75 characters.  We make the default iterator the
recursive iterator, allowing economy in looping over packets.

@ \section{Cif Block class}

The basic building block of a Cif File is the CifBlock, which we
subclass from a CifLoopBlock.  
When initialising, we allow either a set of tuples, suitable for input
to AddCifItem, or a complete block, suitable when copying.

    CifLoopBlock.RemoveLoopItem(self,itemname)

@ Just as for star blocks, we add in the save frame key.  If the
dictionary as supplied doesn't have the item we want, we call the
dictionary method to try to fix the situation.   Once we have a
dictionary supplied, we are able to determine the type of the returned
object, and make the appropriate changes.

@ This function was added for the dictionary validation routines.  It
will return a list where each member is itself a list of item names,
corresponding to the names in each loop of the file.

<<Return all looped names>>=
def loopnames(self):
    return map(lambda a:a.keys(),self.loops)

@ In DDL1 and DDL2, there is not a whole lot of point associating a DDL
dictionary with a CIF file in an ongoing way.  However, with DDLm the dictionary
can be used when searching for attributes, so is no longer simply a checking
mechanism but is now also a generative mechanism.  So there are advantages to
making this assignment for DDLm.

If we are passed a non-DDLm dictionary, we ignore the request as there is
nothing we can do with it outside the normal validity checking, for which
a different routine is in place.

<<Assign a Cif Dictionary>>=
def assign_dictionary(self,dic):
    if not dic.diclang=="DDLm":
        print "Warning: ignoring dictionary %s" % dic.dic_as_cif.my_uri
        return
    self.dictionary = dic

@ Merging.  Normally merging of dictionaries is done at the data file 
level, i.e. a whole block is replaced or added.  However, in 'overlay'
mode, individual keys are added/replaced, which is a block level
operation.  Furthermore, this routine is called when operating on
DDL2 dictionaries as they use save frames, which are
block internal, so all modes have to be supported.

Looped item overlaps are tricky.  We distinguish two cases: at least
one key in common, and all keys in common.  The latter implies 
addition of rows only.  The former implies deletion of all co-occuring
looped items (as they will otherwise have data of different lengths) and
therefore either completely replacing the previous item, or adding
the new data to the end, and including the other co-looped items.  But
this would mean that we were passed a loop block with different data
lengths in the new object, which is illegal, so we can only add to the
end if the new dictionary contains a subset of the attributes in the
current dictionary.  Therefore we have the following rules

(1) Identical attributes in new and old -> append
(2) New contains subset of old -> append values for common items and 
    delete extra looped items
(3) Old contains subset of new -> new completely replaces old

The [[match_att]] keyword is used when old and new blocks have been matched
based on an internal attribute (usually _name or _item.name).  This
attribute should not become looped in overlay mode, obviously, so we
need to have a record of it just in case.

The nosaves keyword means that save frames are ignored when merging.

The rel_keys keyword contains a list of datanames which act as unique keys (in a database
sense) inside loop structures.  If any keys match in separate datablocks, the row will
not be added, but simply replaced.

<<Merge with another block>>=

@ Adding a data item.  We are passed a tuple with the (set) of data
names at the beginning, and a (set) of values for them following. 

If an item is already stored, it will be silently replaced; if it earlier
lived in a loop, it will be removed from the loop, and the loop itself
removed if it is now zero length.

We check the length of the name, and give an error if the name is
greater than 75 characters, which is the CIF 1.1 maximum length.

We also check for consistency, by making sure the new item is
not in the block already.  If it is, we replace it (consistent with
the meaning of square brackets).  If it is in a loop, we replace the
looped value and all other items in that loop block.  This means
that when adding loops, we must add them all at once if we call
this routine directly.

We typecheck the data items.  They can be tuples, strings
or lists.  If we have a list of values for a single item,
the item name should also occur in a single member tuple.

@ \section {Dictionaries}

We would like to abstract out the differences in dictionary 
behaviour,  so we define a dictionary class.  Although we could
subclass this from a [[CifFile]], we have inconsistent behaviour in
that a DDL2 dictionary will need to go through the "saves" key to
get the definitions, whereas the DDL1 dictionary will not.   
Furthermore, the data block in the DDL2 dictionary contains useful
information, so we don't want to hide access to that either.

Fortunately, as both a collection
of save frames and a collection of data blocks are represented by
the same underlying type, initialisation is very easy: in one case we do
nothing, and for DDL2 we return the "saves" item.

A dictionary is optionally specified during initialisation, 
and it is either a filename or a [[CifFile]] type.  

We adopt a data model whereby the excess information in a DDL2
dictionary is absorbed into special methods (and I'm thinking here
of the [[_item_type_list.construct]] stuff which appears at the
global level), which we initialise
ourselves for a DDL1 dictionary.  The square bracket notation
then refers only to the definitions and not to the original
CIF file.

Note that the underscore following the data or save frame header is
technically not part of the name, and so in DDL2 dictionaries there are
two underscores after the word "save".  DDL1 people hadn't figured this
out yet, so we have to add it in by changing each block name.  DDLm
reverts to the DDL1 behaviour, perhaps as a way of emphasizing that
the block name and the contents are semantically different.  Or alternatively,
that the leading underscore is not part of the name.

@ We want to be able to accept strings, giving the file name
of the CIF dictionary, and pre-initialised [[CifFile]] objects.  We do
not accept [[CifDic]] objects.  Our initialisation procedure 
first unifies the interface to the dictionary by finding the 
appropriate [[BlockCollection]], and then runs through the
dictionary producing a normalised form.  Following this, type 
and category information can be collected for later reference.

Validation functions are listed so that it would be possible to
add and remove them from the "valid set".  This behaviour has
not yet been implemented.

When loading DDLm dictionaries we may recursively call this initialisation
function with a dictionary to be imported as the argument.  In this
case we don't want to do all the method derivation, as the necessary
categories will be loaded into the calling dictionary rather than the
currently initialising dictionary.  So there is
a keyword argument to stop the operations that should operate on the
dictionary as a whole taking place.

The dREL methods require Numpy support, but we do not wish to introduce
a global dependence on Numpy.  Therefore, we introduce a 'switch' which
will return Numpy arrays from the __getitem__ method instead of StarLists.
It is intended that the dREL methods will turn this on only during
execution, then turn it off afterwards.

@ DDL1 differences.  Firstly, in DDL1 you can loop a [[_name]] to get
definitions of related names (e.g. x,y,z).  Secondly, the data block
name is missing the initial underscore, so we need to read the [[_name]]
value.  There is one block without a [[_name]] attribute, which we
proceed to destroy (exercise for the reader: which one?).

A further complex difference is in the way that ranges are specified.
A DDL2 dictionary generally loops the [[_item_range.maximum/minimum]]
items, in order to specify inclusion of the endpoints of the range,
whereas DDL1 dictionaries simply specify ranges as [[n:m]].  We
translate these values into [[item_range]] specifications.

If the [[_list]] item is missing for a dictionary definition, it defaults
to no, i.e. the item cannot be listed.  We explicitly include this in
our transformations.

The dictionaries also contain categories, which are used to impose
constraints on groupings of items in lists.  Category names in DDL2
dictionaries have no leading underscore, and the constraints
are stored directly in the category definition.  So, with a DDL1
dictionary, we rewrite things to match the DDL2 methods.  In
particular, the [[list_uniqueness]] item becomes the [[category_key.name]]
attribute of the category.  This may apply to [[_list_mandatory]] and
/or [[_list_reference]] to, but the current specification is vague.

Also, it is possible for cross-item references (e.g. in a 
[[_list_reference]])
to include a whole range of items by terminating the name with an
underscore.  It is then understood to include anything starting with
those characters.  We explicitly try to expand these references out.

Note the way we convert to DDL2-style type definitions; any definition
having a _type_construct regular expression triggers the definition of
a whole new type, which is stored as per DDL2, for the later type
dictionary construction process to find.

@ DDL2 has a few idiosyncracies of its own.  For some reason, in the 
definition of a parent item, all the child items are listed and their
mandatory/not mandatory status specified.  This duplicates information
under the child item itself, although there is something on the web
indicating
that this is purely cosmetic and not strictly necessary.   For our purposes, we want to extract
the mandatory/not mandatory nature of the current item, which appears
to be conventionally at the top of the list (we don't assume this below).
The only way of determining what the actual item name is is to look at
the save frame name, which is a bit of a fragile tactic - especially
as dictionary merge operations are supposed to look for _item.name.

So, in these cases, we have to assume the save frame name is the one we
want, and find this entry in the list.

Additionally, the child entry doesn't contain the category specification,
so we add this into the child entry at the same time, together with a
pointer to the parent item.  

Such entries then have a loop listing parents and children down the whole
hierarchy, starting with the current item.  We disentangle this, placing
parent item attributes in the child items, moving sub-children down to
their level.  Sub children may not exist at all, so we create them if
necessary.

Update: in the DDL-2.1.6 file, only the parents/children are looped,
rather than the item names, so we have to check looping separately.

Next: DDL2 contains aliases to DDL1 item names, so in theory we should be
able to use a DDL2 dictionary to validate a DDL1-style CIF file.  We
create separate definition blocks for each alias to enable this.

Also, we flatten out any single-element lists for item_name.  This is
simply to avoid the value of e.g. category_id being a single-element list
instead of a string.

Note also that _item.category_id in DDL2 is 'implicit', meaning in this case
that you can determine it from the item name.  We add in the category for
simplicity.

@ Normalise DDLm datanames.  While there is no strict requirement that the save frame name
corresponds to the name of the data item defined therein, we make it equivalent so that
all of our access methods work nicely.  Pending a detailed description of how variable
names used in dREL methods are derived, we go the harder route and concatenate the category
name with the object id (although it may be possible to use the _definition.id).  Note
that we do not alter category definitions., and we operate through the standard __setitem__
method of the block collection class in order to properly manage the upper/lower case
housekeeping.

<<Normalise DDLm save frame names>>=
def ddlm_normalise(self):
    for key,value in self.dictionary.items():
       if value.has_key("_name.category_id"):
           real_name = "_" + value["_name.category_id"] + "." + value["_name.object_id"]

           # delete the old one
           del self[key]
    
@ DDLm introduces validity information in the enclosing datablock.  It is a loop of scope,
attribute values where the scope is one of dictionary (everywhere), category (whole
category) and item (just the single definition).  Validity can be [[+]] (mandatory), 
[[.]] encouraged and [[!]] not allowed.  It only appears in the DDLm attributes dictionary, so
this information is blank unless we are dealing with the DDLm dictionary.

<<Parse DDLm validity information>>=
def ddlm_parse_valid(self):
    if not self.dic_as_cif[self.master_key].has_key("_dictionary_valid.scope"):
        return
    for scope_pack in self.dic_as_cif[self.master_key].GetLoop("_dictionary_valid.scope"):
        scope = getattr(scope_pack,"_dictionary_valid.scope")
        valid_info = getattr(scope_pack,"_dictionary_valid.attributes")
        valid_info = valid_info.split()
        for i in range(0,len(valid_info),2): 
            if valid_info[i]=="+":
               self.scopes_mandatory[scope.lower()].append(valid_info[i+1].lower())

               self.scopes_naughty[scope.lower()].append(valid_info[i+1].lower())

@ Dictionaries have the category-wide information in the category
definition area.  We create a map from data block / save frame header to
category id.  For DDL1 the block name has square brackets appended. For DDL2
the category name is kept in the _category.id attribute.  For DDLm, we need
to find all entries with a _definition.scope of "Category".

<<Add category information>>=

categories = filter(lambda a:self[a].has_key("_category.id"),self.keys())
# get the category id
category_ids = map(lambda a:self[a]["_category.id"],categories)

@ Note that as of Oct 2007 we don't know if _definition.scope is mandatory,
so we use a get instead of a straight square bracket.

<<Get list of DDLm categories>>=
categories = filter(lambda a:self[a].get("_definition.scope","Item")=="Category",self.keys())
category_ids = map(lambda a:self[a]["_definition.id"],categories)


@ This method was added to facilitate running dREL scripts, which treat
certain variables as having attributes which all belong to a single category.
We may have to improve this routine later to allow for hierarchical
resolution of datanames.  We return only the extension in keeping with
dREL syntax.

<<List all items in a category>>=

    return map(lambda a:"_" + self[a]["_name.category_id"]+"." + self[a]["_name.object_id"],nameblocks)
    
@ This method was added for DDLm support.  We are passed a category and a
value, and must find a packet which has a matching key.  We use the keyname
as a way of finding the loop.

<<Return a single packet by key>>=

@ Section{DDLm functionality}

DDLm is a far more complex dictionary standard than DDL2.  We are able to import
definitions, for example.  The top-level dictionary notionally contains a very
minimal set of save frame definitions.  We start at this top level and work down,
resolving import references recursively.  This will satisfy the requirement that
conflicts are resolved from the most nested level upwards.

We use the built-in PyCIFRW merging methods.  Note that this merging is done on
the CIFDIC object, and so the dic_as_cif object remains untouched.  Therefore, in future,
audit and tracking information could be stored here.

We originally used the _import_list.id list as the guide for how to import, however, the
draft dictionaries left off items that have a default value, and rather than edit them
all in we defined how to extract the individual items instead.

@ Section{Validation}

These validation checks are intended to be called externally.  They return
a dictionary keyed by item name with value being a list of the
results of the check functions.  The individual functions return a 
dictionary which contains at least the key "result", and in case of error
relevant keys relating to the error.

<<Run validation tests>>=

@ Optimization: the dictionary validation routines normally retain no history
of what has been checked, as they are executed on a per-item basis.  This
leads to duplication of the uniqueness check, when there is more than one
key, and duplication of the parent-child check, once for the parent and 
once for the child.  By switching on optimisation, a record is kept and
these checks will not be repeated.  This is safe only if none of the
relevant items is altered while optimisation is on, and optimisation
should be switched off as soon as all the checks are finished.

@ Some things are independent of where an item occurs in the file; we
check those things here.  All functions are expected to return a

@ Validate the type of an item

We use the expressions for type that we have available to check that
the type of the item passed to us matches up.  We may have a list of
items, so be aware of that.  We define a tiny matching function so
that we don't have to do a double match to catch the non-matching
case, which returns None and thus an attribute error if we immediately
try to get a group.  

Note also that none of the extant dictionaries use the 'none' or 'seq'
values for type.  The seq value in particular would complicate matters.

<<Validate the type of an item>>=
def validate_item_type(self,item_name,item_value):
    def mymatch(m,a):  
        res = m.match(a)

    if len(check_all)>0: return {"result":False,"bad_values":check_all}
    else: return {"result":True}

@ Esds.  Numbers are sometimes not allowed to have esds appended.  The
default is that esds are not OK, and we should also skip anything that
has character type, as that is automatically not a candidate for esds.

Note that we make use of the primitive type here; there are some
cases where a string type looks like an esd, so unless we know
we have a number we ignore these cases.

@ Enumeration ranges.  Our dictionary has been prepared as for a DDL2

@ A utility function to return a list of alternate names given a main name.
In DDL2 we have to deal with aliases.  Each aliased item appears in
our normalised dictionary independently, so there is no need to resolve
aliases when looking up a data name.  However, the original
definition using DDL2-type names is simply copied to this aliased
name during normalisation, so all references to other item names 
(e.g. _item_dependent) have to be resolved using the present function. 

These aliases are returned in any case, so if we had a data file
which mixed DDL1 and DDL2 style names, it may turn out to be
valid, and what's more, we wouldn't necessarily detect an error
if a data name and its alias were present - need to ponder this.

The exclusive_only option will only return items which must not
co-exist with the item name in the same datablock.  This includes
aliases, and allows us to do a check that items and their aliases
are not present at the same time in a data file.

take both a provisional dictionary and a global dictionary; the
provisional dictionary includes items which will go into the
dictionary together with the current item, and the global
dictionary includes items which apply to all data blocks (this is
for validation of DDL1/2 dictionaries).

<<Cross-item validation>>=
<<Validate exclusion rules>>

@ DDL2 dictionaries introduce the "alternate exclusive" category for
related items.  We also unilaterally include items listed in aliases
as acting in this way.

@ When validating parent/child relations, we check the parent link to the
children, and separately check that parents exist for any children present.
Switching on optimisation will remove the redundancy in this procedure, but
only if no changes are made to the relevant data items between the two
checks.  

It appears that DDL2 dictionaries allow parents to be absent if children
take only unspecified values (i.e. dot or question mark).  We catch this
case. 

The provisional items dictionary includes items that are going to be 
included with the present item  (in a single loop structure) so the 
philosophy of inclusion must be all or nothing.

When validating DDL2 dictionaries themselves, we are allowed access to 
other definition blocks in order to resolve parent-child pointers.  
We will be able to find
these save frames inside the globals dictionary (they will in this case
 be collected inside a CifBlock object).

When removing, we look at the item to make sure that no child items require
it to be present.

@ The [[_list_uniqueness]] attribute permits specification of a single or
multiple items which must have a unique combined value.  Currently it is only
used in the powder dictionary to indicate that peaks must have a unique
index and in the core dictionary to indicate the a publication section name
with its label must be unique; however it would appear to implicitly apply 
to any index-type value in any dictionary.  This is used precisely once 
in the cif_core dictionary in a non-intuitive manner, but we code for 
this here.  The value of the [[_list_uniqueness]] attribute can actually 
refer to another data name, which together with the defined name must 
be unique.

DDL2 dictionaries do away with separate [[_list_mandatory]] and [[_list_uniqueness]]
attributes, instead using a [[_category_key]].  If multiple keys are specified,
it appears that they must be unique in combination, judging from the way
that [[_publ_body.label]] and [[_publ_body.element]] are supposed to copy the cif_core
dictionary.

<<Fake mandatory category information>>

@ DDL2 introduces a new idea, that of a mandatory category, items of
which must be present.  We check only this particular fact, and 
leave the checks for mandatory items within the category, keys etc.
to the relevant routines.  This would appear to be applicable to
dictionaries only.

Also, although the natural meaning for a DDL2 dictionary would be that
items from these categories must appear in every definition block, this is not what
happens in practice, as category definitions do not have anything from the
(mandatory) _item_description category.  We therefore adopt the supremely
useless meaning that mandatory categories in a dictionary context mean only
that somewhere, maybe in only one save frame, an item from this category
exists.  This interpretation is forced by using the "fake_mand" argument,
which then assumes that the alternative routine will be used to set the
error information on a dictionary-wide basis.

Note that this routine is constructed such that not all mandatory categories
are checked in the event of a single failure.

@  Given a block containing save frames, this routine compiles a
list of categories which appear in any of the save frames.
It then returns a list of mandatory categories which are not
present in the save frames or enclosing block.

This is for efficiency; as the validation routines are constructed
on a per-block basis, and we try to treat save frames as block
equivalents, we don't want to repeat checks more than we have to.

As this is run outside the normal procedure, which is block based,
we return the information in the same way that the run_data_checks
routine would format it.

@ Preparing our type expressions

In DDL2 dictionaries our type expressions are given in the main
block as POSIX regexps, so we can pass them on to the re package.
For DDL1 dictionaries we could get them from the DDL1 language
definition, but for now we just hard code them.  Essentially only
the number definition is important, as the syntax check during
reading/writing will catch any char violations.

Note that the python re engine is not POSIX compliant in that it will
not return the longest leftmost match, but rather the first leftmost
match.  John Bollinger suggested an obvious fix: we append a [[$]] to force 
a full match.  

In other regexp editing, the [[\{]] sequence inside the character sets of
some of the regexps is actually interpreted as an escaped bracket, so the
backslash vanishes.  We add it back in by doing a very hackish and ugly
substitution which substitues these two characters anywhere that they 
occur inside square brackets.  A final change is to insert a [[\r]] wherever
we find a [[\n]] - it seems that this has been left out. 
After these changes, and appending on default
expressions as well, we can now work with DDL2 expressions directly.

We keep the primitive code for the single reason that we need to
know when we are dealing with a number that has an esd appended, and
this is flagged by the primitive code being of type 'numb'.

@ \section{Linkage to dREL}

The drel_yacc package will create a python function for us.  We use
it during initialisation to transform all methods to python expressions,
and then the [[derive_item]] method will use this to try to derive the
expression.

In order to correctly treat loops over items within drel, we make a list
of all listable categories, and a list of all items which can be made into
an arbitrary length list.  This latter method is very crude, as it
simply searches for an asterisk in the dimension method.

The parser will return a 2-element list [function text, looped categories].
We capture the last element in order to properly loop when the function is
called later.  Note that we generate the general-access functions separately.

We cannot restrict ourselves to local values as the transformed functions
are called elsewhere.  We could include assignments to these variable names
within the generated functions.

If we were really serious about dictionary-driven software, the attribute
lookups that follow would not use get(), but brackets and allow default
values to be returned.  However, that would require assigning a dictionary
to the dictionary and consequent automated searches which I can't be bothered
to do at this stage.  Just be aware that the default value in the get()
statement is the _enumeration.default specified in ddl.dic...

        print "Final result:\n " + self[derivable]["_method.expression"]

@ Drel functions are all stored in category 'functions' in our final dictionary.  We want to
convert them to executable python code and store them in an appropriate namespace which we
can then pass to our individual item methods.

<<Store dREL functions>>=
def add_drel_funcs(self):
    import drel_yacc
    funclist = filter(lambda a:self[a].get("_name.category_id","")=='function',self.keys())

    funcbodys = map(lambda a:self[a]["_method.expression"],funclist)
    # create executable python code...
    parser = drel_yacc.parser
    for funcname,funcbody in zip(funcnames,funcbodys):
        parser.target_id = funcname
        parser.special_id = [{}]   #first element is always global namespace of dictionary
        parser.withtable = {}
        res,ww = parser.parse(funcbody[0])
        print 'dREL library function ->\n' + res
        global_table = globals()
        global_table.update(self.ddlm_functions)
        exec res in global_table    #add to namespace
    print "All functions -> " + `self.ddlm_functions`

@ This is the corresponding method to call to find out the item information,
assuming that the above method was called during initialisation.  For single-valued items, we
call the method directly.  For non-single-valued items, we need to call repeatedly to build up
a complete packet.  We make use of our list of listable categories etc.

If we are building a List rather than a loop, we simply assign the value.  In
a later incarnation, this software should conduct a conformance check on values
which are thus inserted.

We also check out any default values which we could return in case of error.  Note that ddlm
adds the '_enumerations.def_index_id' as an alternative way to derive a value from a table.
During development, we deliberately allow errors arising from the method to
be propagated so that we can see anything that might be wrong.

@ This function converts the string-valued items returned from the parser into
types that correspond to the dictionary specifications.  For DDLm it must also
deal with potentially complex structures containing both strings and numbers. We
have tried to avoid introducing a dependence on Numpy in general for PyCIFRW,
but once we get into the realm of DDLm we require Numpy arrays in order to
handle the various processing tasks.  This routine is the one that will
create the arrays from the StarList types, so needs access to numpy.  However,
this routine is only called if a DDLm dictionary has been provided, so we
should still have no Numpy dependence for non DDLm cases

@ Adding to a loop.  We find the loop containing the dataname that
we've been passed, and then append all of the (key,values) pairs that we
are passed in [[data]], which is a dictionary.  We expect that the data 
have been sorted out for us, unlike when data are passed in [[AddCifItem]], 
when there can be both unlooped and looped data in one set.  The dataname 
passed to this routine is simply a convenient way to refer to the
loop, and has no other significance.

@  Note that a dictionary must be specified in order to create a valid
Cif file.  This dictionary is then passed to any blocks.  If they were
already [[ValidCifBlocks]], they will be reinitialised.  Note that, as
reading a dictionary takes time, we do it immediately to save doing
it later.

As a convenience, we handle lists of filenames/CifFiles which are 
supposed to be dictionaries, and pass them directly to the [[ValidCifBlock]]
object which will merge as necessary.

Note that we have to set bigdic before calling __init__.  The various calls
down through the inheritance hierarchy end up calling ValidCifBlock with
self.bigdic as one of the arguments.  Also, this __init__ procedure could
be called from within StarFile.__init__ if given a filename to read from,
so we allow that bigdic might already have been set - and check for its
existence before setting it again!

@ This uses the  [[CifFile]] merge method to merge a list of filenames,
with an initial check to determine DDL1/DDL2 merge style.  In one
case we merge save frames in a single block, in another case we
merge data blocks.  These are different levels.

Note that the data block name is passed to specify the parts of each object
to be merged, rather than the objects themselves (not doing this was a bug
that was caught a while ago).

@ Find the main item from a parent-child list.  We are asked to find the
topmost parent in a ddl2 definition block containing multiple item.names.
We use the insight that the parent item will be that item which is not in
the list of children as well.  If there are no item names, that means
that we are dealing with something like a category -can they be merged??
