It will use the `SimplestChemenvStrategy` with default settings (i.e. `distance_cutoff=1.4`, `angle_cutoff=0.3`, `Only anion-cation bonds` and `continuous_symmetry_measure_cutoff=10.0` ). With this script, you can also visualize the coordination environments. To do so, please install `vtk` (e.g. via `pip3 install vtk`). Moreover, you can analyze the dependency of the coordination environments on the distance and angular parameters. Just use the 'grid' setting after the question `\"See list of environments determined for each (unequivalent) site ?\"` and choose a site. Now, a tutorial to write your own scripts to analyze the coordination environments will follow."
