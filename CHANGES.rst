* Continuous integration and contribution guidelines now include Python 3.
* **Backwards incompatible changes**

  backwards compatible for the most part.

v2.8.3
------
* Big fix release for json dumping for unitized floats.

v2.8.1
------
* Bug fix release. Incorrect units assigned for ionic radii.
* Improved nwchemio supports COSMO and ESP calculations (Nav Rajput).

v2.8.0
------
* **Units**. Pymatgen now has a new system of managing units,
  defined in pymatgen.core.units. Typical energy, length, time,
  temperature and charge units are supported. Units subclass float,
  which makes the usage transparent in all functions. The value that they
  being are in terms of conversions between different units and addition and
  subtraction of different units of the same type. Some basic quantities
  like ionic radii and atomic masses are now returned in unitized forms for
  easy conversion. Please see :mod:`pymatgen.core.units` and the
  :doc:`examples </examples>` for a demonstration of house to use units in
  pymatgen.
* **Minor backwards-incompatible change**. Structures are now sorted by
  default when generating VASP input files using vaspio_set. Old behavior can
  be obtained by setting sort_structure=False in the constructor. This is
  typically the desired behavior and prevents the generation of large
  POTCARs when atomic species are not grouped together.
* Bug fix for Molecule.substitute. Earlier algorithm was not detecting
  terminal atoms properly.
* Additional conversion tools for ABINIT (by Matteo Giantomassi).

* Much improved ABINIT support (by Matteo Giantomassi).

v2.7.4
------
* Added basic Nwchem (http://www.nwchem-sw.org/) IO support. (by: Shyue Ping
  Ong).
* New MoleculeMatcher class for comparing molecules by RMS. Requires
  openbabel with python bindings. (by: Xiaohui Qu)
* New functional group substitution capability for molecules (by: Lei Cheng
  and Shyue Ping Ong).

v2.7.2
------
* Minor bug fix release to fix some rare errors in very high dimensional
  phase diagrams. **Requires new pyhull version (1.3.8).**

v2.7.1
------
* **Major backwards-incompatible change.** With effect from v2.7.1,
  the default Structure and Molecule classes are now *mutable* objects. All
  functionality in the :mod:`pymatgen.core.structure_modifier` has been
  ported over to the new mutable classes. This change was implemented
  because the immutability of Structure and Molecule has resulted in very
  awkward code to make changes to them. The main cost of this change is that
  Structure and Molecule can no longer be used as dict keys (__hash__ has
  been set to None). However, we believe this is a minor cost given that we
  have rarely seen the use of Structure or Molecule as dict keys in any case.
  For the rare instances where such functionality is needed,
  we have provided the IStructure and IMolecule classes (where I indicates
  immutability) which will perform exactly the same way as the previous
  classes. With this change, the :mod:`pymatgen.core.structure_modifier`
  module is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
* read_structure and write_structure now supports pymatgen's json serialized
  structures.
* read_mol and write_mol functions now available (analogues of
  read_structure and write_structure for molecules)

v2.7.0
------
* Beta support for ABINIT input and output via pymatgen.io.abinitio
  (courtesy of the excellent work of Matteo Giantomassi).
* Properties are now checked when comparing two Species for equality.

  typing. The old input sets have been deprecated.
* New VaspInputSets for MPStatic, MPNonSCF, MITMD which supports uniform
  grid, bandstructure and molecular dynamics calculations. The MD input set
  uses MIT parameters for speed.
* A beta DiffusionAnalysis class in the apps package.
* A revised KPOINT grid algorithm that generates more reasonable meshes.
* A guided install script is now provided for Mac and Linux users.

  space are now also matched in cartesian space and a rms displacement
  normalized by length per atom can be returned using the rms_dist method.

v2.6.2
------

* Site and PeriodicSite now uses a Composition mapping type to represent
  the species and occupancy, instead of a standard dict.
* Bug fix for reading and re-writing out of Potcars.

v2.3.1
------
* Significant improvements to the high-level interface to the Materials API.
  New interface provides more options to make it easier to get structures and
  entries, better warnings and error handling. It uses the *requests*
  library for a cleaner API.

------
* Remove usage of scipy and external qhull callers. Now uses pyhull package.
  Please note that this change implies that the pyhull package is now a
  required dependency. If you install pymatgen through the usual
  easy_install or pip install methods, this should be taken care of
  automatically for you. Otherwise, please look for the pyhull package on
  PyPI to download and install it.
