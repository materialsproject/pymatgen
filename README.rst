Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is a robust, open-source Python library
for materials analysis. It currently powers the public Materials Project
(https://www.materialsproject.org), an initiative to make calculated
properties of all known inorganic materials available to materials
researchers. These are some of the main features:

1. Highly flexible classes for the representation of Element, Site, Molecule,
   Structure objects.
2. Extensive io capabilities to manipulate many VASP
   (http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/) and ABINIT (http://www.abinit.org/)
   input and output files and the crystallographic information file format.
   This includes generating Structure objects from vasp input and output.
   There is also support for Gaussian input files and XYZ file for molecules.
3. Comprehensive tool to generate and view compositional and grand canonical
   phase diagrams.
4. Electronic structure analyses (DOS and Bandstructure).
5. Integration with the Materials Project REST API.

Pymatgen is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this
library by making your own contributions.  These contributions can be in the
form of additional tools or modules you develop, or even simple things such
as bug reports. Please report any bugs and issues at pymatgen's `Github page
<https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen>`_. If you wish to be notified
of pymatgen releases, you may become a member of `pymatgen's Google Groups page
<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pymatgen/>`_.

Python 3.x support
==================

With effect from version 3.0, pymatgen now supports both Python 2.7 as well
as Python 3.x. All underlying core dependencies (numpy,
pyhull and the spglib library) have been made Python 3 compatible,
and a completely rewritten CIF parser module (courtesy of William Davidson
Richards) has removed the dependency on PyCIFRW. We will support Python >= 3.3
(ignoring v3.1 and v3.2). With the release of a new major version,
we also took the opportunity to streamline and cleanup some of the code,
which introduces a few backward incompatibilities.

Why use pymatgen?
=================

There are many materials analysis codes out there, both commerical and free,
but pymatgen offer several advantages:

1. **It is (fairly) robust.** Pymatgen is used in the Materials Project. As
   such, the analysis it produces survives rigorous scrutiny every single
   day. Bugs tend to be found and corrected quickly. Furthermore,
   pymatgen uses `CircleCI <https://circleci.com>`_ for continuous
   integration, which ensures that all unittests pass with every commit.
2. **It is well documented.** A fairly comprehensive documentation has been
   written to help you get to grips with it quickly. That means more
   efficient research.
3. **It is open.** That means you are free to use it, and you can also
   contribute to it. It also means that pymatgen is continuously being
   improved. We have a policy of attributing any code you contribute to any
   publication you choose. Contributing to pymatgen means your research
   becomes more visible, which translates to greater impact.
4. **It is fast.** Many of the core numerical methods in pymatgen have been
   optimized in numpy. This means that coordinate manipulations are extremely
   fast and are in fact comparable to codes written in other languages.
   Pymatgen also comes with a complete system for handling periodic boundary
   conditions.

Getting pymatgen
================

Before installing pymatgen, you may need to first install a few critical
dependencies manually. Please refer to the official `pymatgen page`_ for
installation details and requirements, including instructions for the
bleeding edge developmental version.

The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable
release that is relatively bug-free. The recommended way to install pymatgen
on any system is to use pip (or easy_install), as follows::

    pip install pymatgen

or::

    easy_install pymatgen

Some extra functionality (e.g., generation of POTCARs) do require additional
setup (please see the `pymatgen page`_).

**Note for Windows users**: Given that pymatgen requires several Python C
extensions, it is generally recommended that you install it in a cygwin or
equivalent environment with the necessary compilers.
