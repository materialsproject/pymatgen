Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is a robust, open-source Python library
for materials analysis. These are some of the main features:

1. Highly flexible classes for the representation of Element, Site, Molecule,
   Structure objects.
2. Extensive input/output support, including support for VASP
   (http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/), ABINIT (http://www.abinit.org/), CIF,
   Gaussian, XYZ, and many other file formats.
3. Powerful analysis tools, including generation of phase diagrams, Pourbaix
   diagrams, diffusion analyses, reactions, etc.
4. Electronic structure analyses, such as density of states and band structure.
5. Integration with the Materials Project REST API.

Pymatgen is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this
library by making your own contributions.  These contributions can be in the
form of additional tools or modules you develop, or feature requests and bug
reports. The following are resources for pymatgen:

* Please report any bugs and issues at pymatgen's `Github Issues
  page <https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/issues>`_.
* For help with any pymatgen issue, consult `Stack Overflow
  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pymatgen>`_ and if
  you cannot find an answer, please post a question with the tag "pymatgen".

Why use pymatgen?
=================

There are many materials analysis codes out there, both commerical and free,
but pymatgen offer several advantages:

1. **It is (fairly) robust.** Pymatgen is used by thousands of researchers,
   and is the analysis code powering the `Materials Project`_. The analysis it
   produces survives rigorous scrutiny every single day. Bugs tend to be
   found and corrected quickly. Pymatgen also uses
   `CircleCI <https://circleci.com>`_ and `Appveyor <https://www.appveyor.com/>`_
   for continuous integration on the Linux and Windows platforms,
   respectively, which ensures that every commit passes a comprehensive suite
   of unittests. The coverage of the unittests can be seen on
   `coveralls.io <https://coveralls.io/github/materialsproject/pymatgen>`_.
2. **It is well documented.** A fairly comprehensive documentation has been
   written to help you get to grips with it quickly.
3. **It is open.** You are free to use and contribute to pymatgen. It also means
   that pymatgen is continuously being improved. We will attribute any code you
   contribute to any publication you specify. Contributing to pymatgen means
   your research becomes more visible, which translates to greater impact.
4. **It is fast.** Many of the core numerical methods in pymatgen have been
   optimized by vectorizing in numpy/scipy. This means that coordinate
   manipulations are extremely fast and are in fact comparable to codes
   written in other languages. Pymatgen also comes with a complete system for
   handling periodic boundary conditions.
5. **It will be around.** Pymatgen is not a pet research project. It is used in
   the well-established Materials Project. It is also actively being developed
   and maintained by the `Materials Virtual Lab`_, the ABINIT group and many
   other research groups.

Pymatgen is compatible with both Python 2.7+ as well as latest Python 3.x.
The pymatgen development team will phase out Py2.7 support over the course of
2018. From v2018.1.1, new features implemented in pymatgen no longer need to
support Py2.7 (i.e., unittests do not need to pass Py2k testing), though
existing features will still be Py2.7 compatible. From v2019.1.1, pymatgen will
be Py3k only.

Getting pymatgen
================

Before installing pymatgen, you may need to first install a few critical
dependencies manually. Please refer to the official `pymatgen page`_ for
installation details and requirements, including instructions for the
bleeding edge developmental version. For people who are absolutely new to
Python packages, it is highly recommended you do the installation using
conda, which will make things a lot easier, especially on Windows. Visit
`materials.sh <http://materials.sh>`_ for instructions on how to use the
matsci channel to install pymatgen and other packages.

The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable
release that is relatively bug-free. The easiest way to install pymatgen on
any system is to use pip::

    pip install pymatgen

Wheels for Mac (Python 2.7 and 3.6) and Windows (Python 3.6) have been built
for convenience.

Some extra functionality (e.g., generation of POTCARs) do require additional
setup (please see the `pymatgen page`_).
