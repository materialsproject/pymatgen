#  BKS library - rigid ion potentials for silica

#  NOTE: Because of the large C6 terms (which are unphysical
#        and the short cutoff given in the paper, there will
#        be lots of problems associated with potential 
#        discontinuities if using this library. It should also
#        be noted that the SiO2 potential is known to give the
#        incorrect ground state polymorph for silica. You have
#        been warned!
