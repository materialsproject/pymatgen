</h4>

Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is a robust, open-source Python
library for materials analysis. These are some of the main features:

1. Highly flexible classes for the representation of `Element`, `Site`, `Molecule` and `Structure` objects.
2. Extensive input/output support, including support for [VASP](https://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp), [ABINIT](https://abinit.org), [CIF](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_Information_File), [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com), [XYZ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format), and many other file formats.
3. Powerful analysis tools, including generation of phase diagrams, Pourbaix diagrams, diffusion analyses, reactions, etc.
4. Electronic structure analyses, such as density of states and band structure.
5. Integration with the [Materials Project] REST API.

Pymatgen is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your contributions. These contributions can be in the form of additional tools or modules you develop, or feature requests and bug reports. The following are resources for `pymatgen`:

- [Official documentation][`pymatgen` docs]
- Bug reports or feature requests: Please submit a [GitHub issue].
- Code contributions via [pull request] are welcome.
- For questions that are not bugs or feature requests, please use the `pymatgen` [MatSci forum](https://matsci.org/pymatgen) or open a [GitHub discussion].
- [`matgenb`](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/matgenb#introduction) provides some example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use `pymatgen` functionality.

## Why use `pymatgen`?

1. **It is (fairly) robust.** Pymatgen is used by thousands of researchers and is the analysis code powering the [Materials Project]. The analysis it produces survives rigorous scrutiny every single day. Bugs tend to be found and corrected quickly. Pymatgen also uses Github Actions for continuous integration, which ensures that every new code passes a comprehensive suite of unit tests.
2. **It is well documented.** A fairly comprehensive documentation has been written to help you get to grips with it quickly.
3. **It is open.** You are free to use and contribute to `pymatgen`. It also means that `pymatgen` is continuously being improved. We will attribute any code you contribute to any publication you specify. Contributing to `pymatgen` means your research becomes more visible, which translates to greater impact.
4. **It is fast.** Many of the core numerical methods in `pymatgen` have been optimized by vectorizing in `numpy`/`scipy`. This means that coordinate manipulations are fast. Pymatgen also comes with a complete system for handling periodic boundary conditions.
5. **It will be around.** Pymatgen is not a pet research project. It is used in the well-established Materials Project. It is also actively being developed and maintained by the [Materials Virtual Lab], the ABINIT group and many other research groups.
6. **A growing ecosystem of developers and add-ons**. Pymatgen has contributions from materials scientists all over the world. We also now have an architecture to support add-ons that expand `pymatgen`'s functionality even further. Check out the [contributing page](https://pymatgen.org/contributing) and [add-ons page](https://pymatgen.org/addons) for details and examples.

## Installation

The version at the Python Package Index [PyPI] is always the latest stable release that is relatively bug-free and can be installed via `pip`:

[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/pymatgen

```sh
pip install pymatgen
```

If you'd like to use the latest unreleased changes on the main branch, you can install directly from GitHub:

```sh
pip install -U git+https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen
```

The minimum Python version is 3.9. Some extra functionality (e.g., generation of POTCARs) does require additional setup (see the [`pymatgen` docs]).

## Change Log

See [GitHub releases](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/releases), [`docs/CHANGES.md`](docs/CHANGES.md) or [commit history](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/commits/master) in increasing order of details.

## Using pymatgen

Please refer to the official [`pymatgen` docs] for tutorials and examples.

## About the Pymatgen Development Team

Shyue Ping Ong (@shyuep) of the [Materials Virtual Lab] started Pymatgen in 2011 and is still the project lead.
Janosh Riebesell (@janosh) and Matthew Horton (@mkhorton) are co-maintainers.

The [`pymatgen` development team] is the set of all contributors to the `pymatgen` project, including all subprojects.

## Our Copyright Policy

Pymatgen uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to `pymatgen`. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories.
