* Element now has `ionization_energies`, `ionization_energy` and 
  `electron_affinity` properties.
* Extensive documentation has been added on pymatgen compatibility and the
  new namespace architecture! We have also released a 
  `template repo <https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen-addon-template>`_
  to help new developers write add-ons for pymatgen! Check out our 
  :doc:`contributing page</contributing>` for details.

v2022.0.3
---------
* Another bug fix release! Now SETTINGS have been moved to pymatgen.core.

v2022.0.2 (Yanked)
------------------
* Bug fix release for missing package data files in v2022.0.1

v2022.0.1 (Yanked)
------------------
* `pymatgen`, `pymatgen.ext`, `pymatgen.io` and `pymatgen.analysis` are now
  namespace packages. Note that this does not affect normal usage of pymatgen
  from v2022.0.0. All imports remain the same. However, it does allow developers
  to write "add-ons" to these subpackages. A full documentation with examples
  and templates is in the works to guide developers on how to write these
  packages.

v2022.0.0 (Yanked)
------------------
* This is the new version of pymatgen going forward. Root-level imports have been removed. Please see
  https://pymatgen.org/compatibility.html on how to update your code for compatibility with v2022.

v2021.3.5
---------
* Backwards incompatible changes in v2021.3.4 have been removed. Instead another semantic version v2022.0.0 has been
  released. Future critical bug fixes will be backported to v2021.x.x, but the main line of development will occur on
  v2022.0.0 onwards.

v2021.3.4 (Yanked)
------------------
* **Backwards incompatible**: Pymatgen root imports have been removed from
  v2021.3.4 in preparation for a change to a more modular, extensible
  architecture that will allow more developers to contribute.

  If your existing code uses `from pymatgen import <something>`, you will need to make
  modifications. The easiest way is to use an IDE to run a Search and Replace.
  First, replace any `from pymatgen import MPRester` with
  `from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester`. Then, replace
  `from pymatgen import` with `from pymatgen.core import`. Alternatively, if you
  are using a Mac command line, you can do::

    find . -name '*.py' | xargs sed -i "" 's/from pymatgen import MPRester/from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester/g'
    find . -name '*.py' | xargs sed -i "" 's/from pymatgen import/from pymatgen.core import/g'

  From a Linux command line, you can do::

    find . -name '*.py' | xargs sed -i 's/from pymatgen import MPRester/from pymatgen.ext.matproj import MPRester/g'
    find . -name '*.py' | xargs sed -i 's/from pymatgen import/from pymatgen.core import/g'

  This should resolve most import errors and only a few more modifications may
  need to be done by hand.

  Specifically, the following "convenience imports" have been removed in favor of
  their canonical import::

    from pymatgen import Composition  # now "from pymatgen.core.composition import Composition"
    from pymatgen import Lattice  # now "from pymatgen.core.lattice import Lattice"
    from pymatgen import SymmOp  # now "from pymatgen.core.operations import SymmOp"
    from pymatgen import DummySpecie, DummySpecies, Element, Specie, Species  # now "from pymatgen.core.periodic_table ..."
    from pymatgen import PeriodicSite, Site  # now "from pymatgen.core.sites ..."
    from pymatgen import IMolecule, IStructure, Molecule, Structure  # now "from pymatgen.core.structure ..."
    from pymatgen import ArrayWithUnit, FloatWithUnit, Unit  # now "from pymatgen.core.units ..."
    from pymatgen import Orbital, Spin  # now "from pymatgen.electronic_structure.core ..."
    from pymatgen import MPRester  # now "from pymatgen.ext.matproj ..."


v2021.3.3
---------
* **Backwards incompatible**: pymatgen.SETTINGS have been moved to 
  pymatgen.settings.SETTINGS. In general, this should not lead to many breakages
  since most of these settings are used within pymatgen itself.
* **Backwards incompatible**: pymatgen.loadfn and get_structure_from_mp have been
  removed since no one was using them. 
* critic2_caller has been refactored. (@samblau)
* Improved hash for Compositon (@CompRhys)

* Continuous integration and contribution guidelines now include Python 3.
* **Backwards incompatible changes**

v2.8.1
------
* Bug fix release. Incorrect units assigned for ionic radii.
* Improved nwchemio supports COSMO and ESP calculations (Nav Rajput).

v2.8.0
------
* **Units**. Pymatgen now has a new system of managing units,
  defined in pymatgen.core.units. Typical energy, length, time,
  temperature and charge units are supported. Units subclass float,
  which makes the usage transparent in all functions. The value that they
  being are in terms of conversions between different units and addition and
  subtraction of different units of the same type. Some basic quantities
  like ionic radii and atomic masses are now returned in unitized forms for
  easy conversion. Please see :mod:`pymatgen.core.units` and the
  :doc:`examples </examples>` for a demonstration of house to use units in
  pymatgen.
* **Minor backwards-incompatible change**. Structures are now sorted by
  default when generating VASP input files using vaspio_set. Old behavior can
  be obtained by setting sort_structure=False in the constructor. This is
  typically the desired behavior and prevents the generation of large
  POTCARs when atomic species are not grouped together.
* Bug fix for Molecule.substitute. Earlier algorithm was not detecting
  terminal atoms properly.
* Additional conversion tools for ABINIT (by Matteo Giantomassi).

------
* Added basic Nwchem (http://www.nwchem-sw.org/) IO support. (by: Shyue Ping
  Ong).

  openbabel with python bindings. (by: Xiaohui Qu)
* New functional group substitution capability for molecules (by: Lei Cheng
  and Shyue Ping Ong).

v2.7.2
------
* Minor bug fix release to fix some rare errors in very high dimensional
  phase diagrams. **Requires new pyhull version (1.3.8).**

v2.7.1
------
* **Major backwards-incompatible change.** With effect from v2.7.1,
  the default Structure and Molecule classes are now *mutable* objects. All
  functionality in the :mod:`pymatgen.core.structure_modifier` has been
  ported over to the new mutable classes. This change was implemented
  because the immutability of Structure and Molecule has resulted in very
  awkward code to make changes to them. The main cost of this change is that
  Structure and Molecule can no longer be used as dict keys (__hash__ has
  been set to None). However, we believe this is a minor cost given that we
  have rarely seen the use of Structure or Molecule as dict keys in any case.
  For the rare instances where such functionality is needed,
  we have provided the IStructure and IMolecule classes (where I indicates
  immutability) which will perform exactly the same way as the previous
  classes. With this change, the :mod:`pymatgen.core.structure_modifier`
  module is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
* read_structure and write_structure now supports pymatgen's json serialized
  structures.
* read_mol and write_mol functions now available (analogues of
  read_structure and write_structure for molecules)

------
* Beta support for ABINIT input and output via pymatgen.io.abinitio
  (courtesy of the excellent work of Matteo Giantomassi).

  typing. The old input sets have been deprecated.
* New VaspInputSets for MPStatic, MPNonSCF, MITMD which supports uniform
  grid, bandstructure and molecular dynamics calculations. The MD input set
  uses MIT parameters for speed.
* A beta DiffusionAnalysis class in the apps package.
* A revised KPOINT grid algorithm that generates more reasonable meshes.

  space are now also matched in cartesian space and a rms displacement
  normalized by length per atom can be returned using the rms_dist method.

  the species and occupancy, instead of a standard dict.

  New interface provides more options to make it easier to get structures and
  entries, better warnings and error handling. It uses the *requests*
  library for a cleaner API.

* Remove usage of scipy and external qhull callers. Now uses pyhull package.
  Please note that this change implies that the pyhull package is now a
  required dependency. If you install pymatgen through the usual
  easy_install or pip install methods, this should be taken care of
  automatically for you. Otherwise, please look for the pyhull package on
  PyPI to download and install it.
