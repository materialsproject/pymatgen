As (Bunge) 4s 4p_y 4p_z 4p_x 
Ga (Bunge) 4s 4p_y 4p_z 4p_x 3d_xy 3d_yz 3d_z^2 3d_xz 3d_x^2-y^2 
INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 14 and upwards will be ignored.
