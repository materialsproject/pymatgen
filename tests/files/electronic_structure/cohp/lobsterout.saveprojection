INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 21 and upwards will be ignored.

WARNING: 3 of 147 k-points could not be orthonormalized with an accuracy of 1.0E-5.
WARNING: Generally, this is not a critical error. But to help you analyze it,
WARNING: I dumped the band overlap matrices to the file bandOverlaps.lobster.
WARNING: Please check how much they deviate from the identity matrix and decide to
WARNING: use your results only, if you are sure that this is ok.
